This class cannot be inherited.\n  remarks: \"This class provides several static methods and properties that expose management and administrative functionality for Web Parts personalization. These methods apply to the default personalization provider configured in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control for a Web Parts control. If you need to administer several data stores that are acting as personalization providers, you should use the methods on the individual personalization provider classes directly. Note that the collection of configured personalization providers for a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control is available from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PersonalizationAdministration.Providers%2A> static property.  \\n  \\n It is important to be aware that personalization will fail if your Web application does not run at the default trust level of <xref:System.Web.AspNetHostingPermissionLevel.Medium> or higher (you can set custom trust levels in a Web.config file using the `<trust level=\\\"\\\" />` element). The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PersonalizationAdministration> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.SqlPersonalizationProvider> classes both check for a trust level of <xref:System.Web.AspNetHostingPermissionLevel.Low> when they are initialized. If you configure your application to run at a trust level of <xref:System.Web.AspNetHostingPermissionLevel.Low>, and you use the default <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.SqlPersonalizationProvider> provider to manage the personalization data for your application, the first time that the application tries to access personalization data, it will fail because an ASP.NET worker process running in <xref:System.Web.AspNetHostingPermissionLevel.Low> trust does not have the permissions necessary to call into the various classes in the <xref:System.Data.SqlClient> namespace.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example demonstrates how to use several methods in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PersonalizationAdministration> class.

The returned collection contains only <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.UserPersonalizationStateInfo> instances.  \\n  \\n This method passes query wildcard characters to the underlying data store. Support for wildcard characters is currently dependent on how each provider handles characters such as an asterisk (*), a percent symbol (%), or an underscore (_).  \\n  \\n Normally, for SQL-compliant data stores, you can perform a wildcard search on a partial path with the wildcard character appearing at the beginning, the end, or the middle of the search string text in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PersonalizationStateQuery.PathToMatch%2A> property. For example, to find all paths that start with \\\"~/vdir\\\", the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PersonalizationStateQuery.PathToMatch%2A> property would be set to \\\"~/vdir%\\\".  \\n  \\n Likewise, a wildcard search on a partial user name could have the wildcard character appear at any point in the text string of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PersonalizationStateQuery.UsernameToMatch%2A> property. For example, to find all user names that start with \\\"John\\\", the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PersonalizationStateQuery.UsernameToMatch%2A> property would look like \\\"John%\\\".  \\n  \\n Using the default personalization provider, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PersonalizationStateInfo>-derived objects are returned in alphabetical order, and sorted by a combination of path and user name in ascending order.

The collection contains only <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.UserPersonalizationStateInfo> instances.  \\n  \\n This method passes parameter wildcard characters to the underlying personalization provider, so how the data store handles these characters depends on how the provider handles characters as an asterisk (*), a percent symbol (%), or an underscore (_).  \\n  \\n Normally, for SQL-compliant data stores, you can perform a wildcard search on a partial path with the wildcard character appearing at the beginning, the end, or the middle of the search string text in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PersonalizationStateQuery.PathToMatch%2A> property. For example, to find all paths that start with \\\"~/vdir\\\", the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PersonalizationStateQuery.PathToMatch%2A> property would be set to \\\"~/vdir%\\\".  \\n  \\n Likewise, a wildcard search on a partial user name could have the wildcard character appear at any point in the text string of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PersonalizationStateQuery.UsernameToMatch%2A> property. For example, to find all user names that start with \\\"John\\\", the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PersonalizationStateQuery.UsernameToMatch%2A> property would look like \\\"John%\\\".  \\n  \\n Using the default personalization provider, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PersonalizationStateInfo>-derived objects are returned in alphabetical order, and sorted by a combination of path and user name in ascending order. The order of the objects in the collection is determined by the provider.  \\n  \\n Both `pathToMatch` and `usernameToMatch` can be `null`. The `usernameToMatch` parameter can have commas (,) because some data stores, such as those running Microsoft SQL Server, allow commas as wildcard characters.  \\n  \\n The data returned is constrained by `pageIndex` and `pageSize`, where `pageIndex` controls which records to return and `pageSize` controls the number of records to return. For example, if `pageIndex` was set to 0 and `pageSize` was set to 25, the data returned would be the first 25 entries.
