<xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroupCollection> associated with a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control. This collection contains the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroup> objects that represent the groups shown in the control when the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.View%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property is set to a value other than <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View?displayProperty=fullName>. Any items that are not assigned to a group will appear in the default group, which has the header label \\\"DefaultGroup{0}\\\". The default group is not contained in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.Groups%2A?displayProperty=fullName> collection, and cannot be altered. It is primarily useful in debugging to ensure that all items have been properly added to groups. If there are no groups in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.Groups%2A?displayProperty=fullName> collection, the grouping feature is disabled.  \\n  \\n Use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroupCollection.Add%2A> method to add a single group to the collection. Use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroupCollection.Insert%2A> method to add a group at a particular index within the collection. To remove a group, use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroupCollection.Remove%2A> method. Use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroupCollection.RemoveAt%2A> method to remove the group at a particular index.  \\n  \\n You cannot add a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroup> to the collection more than once. To reposition a group within the collection, it must first be removed from the collection, and then inserted at the desired location. Use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroupCollection.Contains%2A> method to determine whether a particular group is already in the collection. To retrieve the index of a group within the collection, use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroupCollection.IndexOf%2A> method. You can get or set the group at a particular index with the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroupCollection.Item%2A> indexer.  \\n  \\n Use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroupCollection.AddRange%2A> method to add multiple groups to the collection. You can add multiple groups either as an array of groups or as a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroupCollection> that you retrieve through the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.Groups%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property of another <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control. Use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroupCollection.Clear%2A> method to remove all the groups from the collection.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroupCollection.Remove%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroupCollection.RemoveAt%2A>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroupCollection.Clear%2A> methods remove groups from the collection, but do not remove any items from the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control. If there are no groups in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.Groups%2A?displayProperty=fullName> collection, the grouping feature is disabled and all items in the control are displayed normally.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroupCollection.AddRange%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroupCollection.Clear%2A> methods are useful when you want to provide multiple ways to group the items in a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control. To do this, create multiple group arrays. To change the grouping, first use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroupCollection.Clear%2A> method to remove all the groups from the collection, then use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroupCollection.AddRange%2A> method to add the next array of groups to display.  \\n  \\n Use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroupCollection.CopyTo%2A> method to copy the groups in a collection to a compatible array starting at a specified index. This is useful, for example, when you want to sort the groups in the collection using the <xref:System.Array.Sort%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method. To do this, copy the groups into a compatible array, then sort the array. Next, use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroupCollection.Clear%2A> method to remove all the groups from the collection, then use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroupCollection.AddRange%2A> method to add the sorted array back to the collection.  \\n  \\n Use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroupCollection.Count%2A> property to determine how many groups are in the collection. To iterate through the collection, use the <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator> returned from the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroupCollection.GetEnumerator%2A> method.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  The grouping feature is available only on Windows XP and the Windows Server 2003 family when your application calls the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Application.EnableVisualStyles%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method. On earlier operating systems, any code relating to groups will be ignored and the groups will not appear. As a result, any code that depends on the grouping feature might not work correctly. You might want to include a test that determines whether the grouping feature is available, and provide alternate functionality when it is unavailable. For example, you might want to provide alternate sorting when running on operating systems that do not support sorting by group.  \\n>   \\n>  The insertion mark feature is provided by the same library that provides the operating system themes feature. To check for the availability of this library, call the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FeatureSupport.IsPresent%28System.Object%29?displayProperty=fullName> method overload and pass in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.OSFeature.Themes?displayProperty=fullName> value.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following example demonstrates how to use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> grouping feature to organize items by subitem value in the details view. This form of grouping is similar to the grouping used in Windows Explorer. In the example, the groups are created dynamically. For each subitem column, one group is created for each unique subitem value. For the parent item column, one group is created for each unique initial letter. Clicking the header of a column sorts the items into the groups created for that column. Clicking the same column header again reverses the order of the groups.  \\n  \\n [!code-cpp[System.Windows.Forms.ListView.Groups#1](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.ListView.Groups/CPP/listviewgroupsexample.cpp#1)]\\n [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.ListView.Groups#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.ListView.Groups/CS/listviewgroupsexample.cs#1)]\\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.ListView.Groups#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.ListView.Groups/VB/listviewgroupsexample.vb#1)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: >-\n      [System.ComponentModel.ListBindable(false)]\n\n      public class ListViewGroupCollection : System.Collections.IList\n  inheritance:\n  - System.Object\n  implements:\n  - System.Collections.IList\n  inheritedMembers:\n  - System.Object.Equals(System.Object)\n  - System.Object.Equals(System.Object,System.Object)\n  - System.Object.GetHashCode\n  - System.Object.GetType\n  - System.Object.MemberwiseClone\n  - System.Object.ReferenceEquals(System.Object,System.Object)\n  - System.Object.ToString\n  extensionMethods:\n  - System.Linq.Enumerable.Cast``1(System.Collections.IEnumerable)\n  - System.Linq.Enumerable.OfType``1(System.Collections.IEnumerable)\n  - System.Linq.ParallelEnumerable.AsParallel(System.Collections.IEnumerable)\n  - System.Linq.Queryable.AsQueryable(System.Collections.IEnumerable)\n  attributes:\n  - type: System.ComponentModel.ListBindableAttribute\n  version:\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  monikers:\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  content_git_url: https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/xml/System.Windows.Forms/ListViewGroupCollection.xml\n  ms.technology:\n  - dotnet-winforms\n  ms.author: kempb\n  manager: ghogen\n- uid: System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroupCollection.Add(System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroup)\n  commentId: M:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroupCollection.Add(System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroup)\n  id: Add(System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroup)\n  parent: System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroupCollection\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: Add(ListViewGroup)\n  nameWithType: ListViewGroupCollection.Add(ListViewGroup)\n  fullName: ListViewGroupCollection.Add(ListViewGroup)\n  type: Method\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Windows.Forms\n  namespace: System.Windows.Forms\n  summary: Adds the specified <xref href=\"System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroup\"></xref> to the collection.\n  remarks: \"Use this method to add an existing <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroup> to the collection.
