For more information about creating and using speech recognition grammars, see [Speech Recognition](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/6a7dc524-07fc-4862-8d48-8c10dc64b919),  [Create Grammars Using XML](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/2d799487-49c6-4cc9-b42f-f71cd3824fe1), [Create Grammars Using GrammarBuilder](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/7e2cc577-cb05-4318-9da3-7c8675d3d9ae), and [Create Grammars Using SrgsGrammar](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/e4d9f96e-2241-4c39-b9e0-ac9ef4e9a906).  \\n  \\n After you author a grammar, you must build it into a <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.Grammar> object that a speech recognition engine can load and that your application can use at runtime to manage speech recognition. You can use a <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.Grammar.%23ctor%2A> constructor to create a <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.Grammar> instance from a <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.GrammarBuilder> or a <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SrgsGrammar.SrgsDocument> object, or from a file or a <xref:System.IO.Stream> that contains a description of a grammar in a supported format. Supported formats include the following:  \\n  \\n-   XML-format files that conform to the W3C [Speech Recognition Grammar Specification (SRGS) Version 1.0](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=201761)  \\n  \\n-   Grammars that have been compiled to a binary file with a .cfg file extension  \\n  \\n Grammar constructors that accept XML-format grammar files in their arguments compile the XML grammars to a binary format to optimize them for loading and consumption by a speech recognition engine. You can reduce the amount of time required to construct a <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.Grammar> object from an XML-format grammar by compiling the grammar in advance, using one of the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SrgsGrammar.SrgsGrammarCompiler.Compile%2A> methods.  \\n  \\n An application's speech recognition engine, as managed by a <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognizer> or <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SpeechRecognitionEngine> object, can load multiple speech recognition grammars. The application can independently enable or disable individual grammars by setting the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.Grammar.Enabled%2A> property, and modify recognition behavior through <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.Grammar> properties, such as the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.Grammar.Priority%2A> and <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.Grammar.Weight%2A> properties.  \\n  \\n The grammar’s <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.Grammar.SpeechRecognized> event is raised when input matches a path through the grammar.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  It is a best practice to verify the safety of any URI or DLL used to build a <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.Grammar> object.  \\n>   \\n>  Windows and the Speech platform provide security for applications constructing a <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.Grammar> instance from a DLL or from a grammar that supports scripting.  \\n>   \\n>  Scripts in <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.Grammar> objects are always run as if downloaded from a web page in the `Internet Zone`.
