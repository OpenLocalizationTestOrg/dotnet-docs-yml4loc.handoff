The displayed advertisement changes whenever the page refreshes.  \n  \n Advertisement information is stored in a separate XML file. The XML file allows you to maintain a list of advertisements and their associated attributes. Attributes include the path to an image to display, the URL to link to when the control is clicked, the alternate text to display when the image is not available, a keyword, and the frequency of the advertisement. Information in this file is not validated by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AdRotator> control. To prevent ads from executing malicious scripts, you should always check the data before releasing it, or accept ad information only from trusted sources.  \n  \n To secure your advertisement file from unauthorized Internet access, do one or more of the following:  \n  \n-   Store it in the App_Data directory, which is configured to deny Internet access for files of any type.  \n  \n-   Rename the file with an extension that is not .xml, and map the extension to the `HttpForbiddenHandler` in Web.config. For more information, see the  section in your Machine.config file.  \n  \n As an alternative to an XML file as the source of data, it is possible to provide advertisement information through a callback event. This event can also be used in combination with the XML file to extend the behavior of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AdRotator> control, such as redirecting to another page. See the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AdRotator.AdvertisementFile%2A> property for additional information on the file format.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  When page caching is enabled, an <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AdRotator> control is not cached. A new advertisement is selected whenever the Web page refreshes. A new advertisement is not selected, however, if you provide an event handler for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AdRotator.AdCreated> event.  \n  \n<a name=\"XMLAdvertisementFileFormat\"></a>   \n## XML Advertisement File Format  \n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AdRotator> control uses a separate XML advertisement file to store the advertisement information, such as the location of the image to display and the URL of the page to link to. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AdRotator.AdvertisementFile%2A> property of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AdRotator> control specifies the path to this file.  \n  \n When creating the advertisement file, opening and closing `<Advertisements>` tags mark the beginning and the end of the file, respectively. Opening and closing `<Ad>` tags delimit each advertisement. All advertisements are nested between the opening and closing `<Advertisements>` tags. If the file contains multiple `<Advertisements>` tags, only the first set of `<Advertisements>` tags in the file will be parsed by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AdRotator> control. All other `<Advertisements>` tags will be ignored.  \n  \n The data elements for each advertisement are nested between the opening and closing `<Ad>` tags. Although certain data elements are predefined (such as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AdCreatedEventArgs.ImageUrl%2A> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AdCreatedEventArgs.NavigateUrl%2A>), you can place custom elements between the `<Ad>` tags. These elements will be read by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AdRotator> control when it parses the file. The information is then passed to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AdRotator.AdCreated> event in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AdCreatedEventArgs.AdProperties%2A> dictionary property.  \n  \n The following table lists the data elements that are predefined for the XML advertisement file.  \n  \n|Element|Description|  \n|-------------|-----------------|  \n|`ImageUrl`|The absolute or relative URL to an image file (optional).|  \n|`NavigateUrl`|The URL of a page to link to if the user clicks the ad (optional). **Note:**  If this element is not set, the `HRef` property is not rendered on the anchor tag.|  \n|`Height`|The height of the image, in pixels (optional).|  \n|`Width`|The width of the image, in pixels (optional).|  \n|`AlternateText`|The text display in place of the image when the image specified by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AdCreatedEventArgs.ImageUrl%2A> property is not available (optional).<br /><br /> In some browsers, this text also appears as a `ToolTip` for the advertisement.|  \n|`Keyword`|A category for the advertisement (for example, \"computers\") that you can filter by (optional).|  \n|`Impressions`|A number that indicates the importance of the ad in the schedule of rotation relative to the other ads in the file (optional).<br /><br /> The larger the number, the more often the ad is displayed. The total of all `<Impressions>` values in the XML file cannot exceed 2,047,999,999*.* If it does, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AdRotator> control throws a run-time exception.|  \n  \n The following example shows the format for the XML advertisement file.  \n  \n```  \n<Advertisements>  \n  <Ad>  \n    <ImageUrl>  \n      URL of image to display for Advertisement #1  \n    </ImageUrl>  \n    <NavigateUrl>  \n      URL of page to link to for Advertisement #1  \n    </NavigateUrl>  \n    <AlternateText>  \n      Text to show as a ToolTip for Advertisement #1  \n    </AlternateText>  \n    <Keyword>  \n      Keyword used to filter for Advertisement #1  \n    </Keyword>  \n    <Impressions>  \n       Relative importance of Advertisement #1  \n    </Impressions>  \n    <CustomInformation>  \n      Custom Data about Advertisement #1  \n    </CustomInformation>  \n  </Ad>  \n</Advertisements>  \n```  \n  \n<a name=\"DeclarativeSyntax\"></a>   \n## Declarative Syntax  \n  \n```  \n<asp:AdRotator  \n    AccessKey=\"string\"  \n    AdvertisementFile=\"uri\"  \n    AlternateTextField=\"string\"  \n    BackColor=\"color name|#dddddd\"  \n    BorderColor=\"color name|#dddddd\"  \n    BorderStyle=\"NotSet|None|Dotted|Dashed|Solid|Double|Groove|Ridge|  \n        Inset|Outset\"  \n    BorderWidth=\"size\"  \n    CssClass=\"string\"  \n    DataMember=\"string\"  \n    DataSource=\"string\"  \n    DataSourceID=\"string\"  \n    Enabled=\"True|False\"  \n    EnableTheming=\"True|False\"  \n    EnableViewState=\"True|False\"  \n    ForeColor=\"color name|#dddddd\"  \n    Height=\"size\"  \n    ID=\"string\"  \n    ImageUrlField=\"string\"  \n    KeywordFilter=\"string\"  \n    NavigateUrlField=\"string\"  \n    OnAdCreated=\"AdCreated event handler\"  \n    OnDataBinding=\"DataBinding event handler\"  \n    OnDataBound=\"DataBound event handler\"  \n    OnDisposed=\"Disposed event handler\"  \n    OnInit=\"Init event handler\"  \n    OnLoad=\"Load event handler\"  \n    OnPreRender=\"PreRender event handler\"  \n    OnUnload=\"Unload event handler\"  \n    runat=\"server\"  \n    SkinID=\"string\"  \n    Style=\"string\"  \n    TabIndex=\"integer\"  \n    Target=\"string|_blank|_parent|_search|_self|_top\"  \n    ToolTip=\"string\"  \n    Visible=\"True|False\"  \n    Width=\"size\"  \n/>  \n```","nodes":[{"pos":[0,14],"content":"In this topic:","nodes":[{"content":"In this topic:","pos":[0,14]}]},{"pos":[24,53],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Introduction<ept id=\"p1\">](#Introduction)</ept>","source":"[Introduction](#Introduction)"},{"pos":[63,123],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>XML Advertisement File Format<ept id=\"p1\">](#XMLAdvertisementFileFormat)</ept>","source":"[XML Advertisement File Format](#XMLAdvertisementFileFormat)"},{"pos":[133,173],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Declarative Syntax<ept id=\"p1\">](#DeclarativeSyntax)</ept>","source":"[Declarative Syntax](#DeclarativeSyntax)"},{"pos":[213,225],"content":"Introduction","linkify":"Introduction","nodes":[{"content":"Introduction","pos":[0,12]}]},{"pos":[229,421],"content":"Use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AdRotator> control to display a randomly selected advertisement banner on the Web page.

The displayed advertisement changes whenever the page refreshes.  \\n  \\n Advertisement information is stored in a separate XML file. The XML file allows you to maintain a list of advertisements and their associated attributes. Attributes include the path to an image to display, the URL to link to when the control is clicked, the alternate text to display when the image is not available, a keyword, and the frequency of the advertisement. Information in this file is not validated by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AdRotator> control. To prevent ads from executing malicious scripts, you should always check the data before releasing it, or accept ad information only from trusted sources.  \\n  \\n To secure your advertisement file from unauthorized Internet access, do one or more of the following:  \\n  \\n-   Store it in the App_Data directory, which is configured to deny Internet access for files of any type.  \\n  \\n-   Rename the file with an extension that is not .xml, and map the extension to the `HttpForbiddenHandler` in Web.config. For more information, see the  section in your Machine.config file.  \\n  \\n As an alternative to an XML file as the source of data, it is possible to provide advertisement information through a callback event. This event can also be used in combination with the XML file to extend the behavior of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AdRotator> control, such as redirecting to another page. See the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AdRotator.AdvertisementFile%2A> property for additional information on the file format.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  When page caching is enabled, an <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AdRotator> control is not cached. A new advertisement is selected whenever the Web page refreshes. A new advertisement is not selected, however, if you provide an event handler for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AdRotator.AdCreated> event.  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"XMLAdvertisementFileFormat\\\"></a>   \\n## XML Advertisement File Format  \\n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AdRotator> control uses a separate XML advertisement file to store the advertisement information, such as the location of the image to display and the URL of the page to link to. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AdRotator.AdvertisementFile%2A> property of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AdRotator> control specifies the path to this file.  \\n  \\n When creating the advertisement file, opening and closing `<Advertisements>` tags mark the beginning and the end of the file, respectively. Opening and closing `<Ad>` tags delimit each advertisement. All advertisements are nested between the opening and closing `<Advertisements>` tags. If the file contains multiple `<Advertisements>` tags, only the first set of `<Advertisements>` tags in the file will be parsed by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AdRotator> control. All other `<Advertisements>` tags will be ignored.  \\n  \\n The data elements for each advertisement are nested between the opening and closing `<Ad>` tags. Although certain data elements are predefined (such as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AdCreatedEventArgs.ImageUrl%2A> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AdCreatedEventArgs.NavigateUrl%2A>), you can place custom elements between the `<Ad>` tags. These elements will be read by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AdRotator> control when it parses the file. The information is then passed to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AdRotator.AdCreated> event in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AdCreatedEventArgs.AdProperties%2A> dictionary property.  \\n  \\n The following table lists the data elements that are predefined for the XML advertisement file.  \\n  \\n|Element|Description|  \\n|-------------|-----------------|  \\n|`ImageUrl`|The absolute or relative URL to an image file (optional).|  \\n|`NavigateUrl`|The URL of a page to link to if the user clicks the ad (optional). **Note:**  If this element is not set, the `HRef` property is not rendered on the anchor tag.|  \\n|`Height`|The height of the image, in pixels (optional).|  \\n|`Width`|The width of the image, in pixels (optional).|  \\n|`AlternateText`|The text display in place of the image when the image specified by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AdCreatedEventArgs.ImageUrl%2A> property is not available (optional).<br /><br /> In some browsers, this text also appears as a `ToolTip` for the advertisement.|  \\n|`Keyword`|A category for the advertisement (for example, \\\"computers\\\") that you can filter by (optional).|  \\n|`Impressions`|A number that indicates the importance of the ad in the schedule of rotation relative to the other ads in the file (optional).<br /><br /> The larger the number, the more often the ad is displayed.

If you use a relative path, that path is relative to the location of the page or user control that contains the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AdRotator> control.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AdRotator.AdvertisementFile%2A> property is optional. An advertisement can also be programmatically set in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AdRotator.AdCreated> event.  \\n  \\n The XML file contains the following predefined attributes. Only the `ImageUrl` attribute is required.  \\n  \\n|Attribute|Description|  \\n|---------------|-----------------|  \\n|`ImageUrl`|The URL of the image to display.|  \\n|`Height`|The height of the image, in pixels (optional).|  \\n|`Width`|The width of the image, in pixels (optional).|  \\n|`NavigateUrl`|The URL of the page to navigate to when the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AdRotator> control is clicked.|  \\n|`AlternateText`|The text to display if the image is unavailable. On some browsers, this text is displayed as a ToolTip.|  \\n|`Keyword`|The category for the advertisement. This is used by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AdRotator> control to filter the list of advertisements for a specific category.|  \\n|`Impressions`|A value that indicates how often an advertisement is displayed in relation to other advertisements in the XML file.|  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  The `ImageUrl` and `NavigateUrl` attributes can be a full URL, a root-relative path, or a relative path. If you use a root-relative path, the path is relative to the same Web site. If you use a relative path, the path is relative to the directory that contains the advertisement file.  \\n  \\n You can also include custom attributes by using custom tags in the XML file. All attribute tags are parsed from the advertisement file, and the values are placed in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AdCreatedEventArgs.AdProperties%2A> dictionary. You can use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AdCreatedEventArgs.AdProperties%2A> dictionary to programmatically access your custom attributes.  \\n  \\n Information in this file is not validated by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AdRotator> control. To prevent ads from executing malicious scripts, you should always check the data before releasing it, or accept ad information only from trusted sources.  \\n  \\n To secure your advertisement file from unauthorized Internet access, do one or more of the following:  \\n  \\n-   Store it in the Data directory, which is configured in Machine.config to deny Internet access for files of any type.  \\n  \\n-   Rename the file with an extension that is not .xml, and map the extension to `HttpForbiddenHandler` in Web.config. For more information, see the  section in your Machine.config file.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example demonstrates how to use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AdRotator.AdvertisementFile%2A> property to specify the location of the XML file that contains advertisement information.  \\n  \\n <!-- TODO: review snippet reference [!code-csharp[Classic AdRotator.AdvertisementFile Example#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_WebNet/Classic AdRotator.AdvertisementFile Example/CS/sourcecs.aspx#1)]  -->\\n <!-- TODO: review snippet reference [!code-vb[Classic AdRotator.AdvertisementFile Example#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_WebNet/Classic AdRotator.AdvertisementFile Example/VB/sourcevb.aspx#1)]  -->  \\n  \\n The following code example shows the file format of the XML advertisement file.  \\n  \\n```  \\n<Advertisements>  \\n  <Ad>  \\n    <ImageUrl>~/Images/image1.jpg</ImageUrl>  \\n    <Height>60</Height>  \\n    <Width>190</Width>  \\n    <NavigateUrl>http://www.microsoft.com</NavigateUrl>  \\n    <AlternateText>Microsoft Main Site</AlternateText>  \\n    <Impressions>80</Impressions>  \\n    <Keyword>Topic1</Keyword>  \\n    <Caption>This is the caption for Ad#1</Caption>   \\n  </Ad>  \\n  <Ad>  \\n    <ImageUrl>~/Images/image2.jpg</ImageUrl>  \\n    <Height>90</Height>  \\n    <Width>90</Width>  \\n    <NavigateUrl>http://www.wingtiptoys.com</NavigateUrl>  \\n    <AlternateText>Wingtip Toys</AlternateText>  \\n    <Impressions>80</Impressions>  \\n    <Keyword>Topic2</Keyword>  \\n    <Caption>This is the caption for Ad#2</Caption>   \\n  </Ad>  \\n</Advertisements>  \\n```\"\n  syntax:\n    content: >-\n      [System.ComponentModel.Bindable(true)]\n\n      public string AdvertisementFile { get; set; }\n    return:\n      type: System.String\n      description: The location of an XML file containing advertisement information.
