However, the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Compatibility.VB6.LabelArray.MouseClick> event will not be raised if the click is caused by action other than that of the mouse, such as pressing the ENTER key.  \\n  \\n A double-click is determined by the mouse settings of the user's operating system. The user can set the time between clicks of a mouse button that should be considered a double-click instead of two clicks. The `Click` event is raised every time that a control is double-clicked. For example, if you have event handlers for the `Click` and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DoubleClick> events of a [control](ms-help://MS.VSCC.v90/MS.MSDNQTR.v90.en/fxref_system.windows.forms/html/6569d671-0a28-7b3f-dbb8-90c3d272b6e2.htm), the `Click` and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DoubleClick> events are raised when the control is double-clicked and both methods are called.

The layout event can be suppressed by using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.SuspendLayout%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.ResumeLayout%2A> methods. Suspending layout enables you to perform multiple actions on a control without having to perform a layout for each change. For example, if you resize and move a control, each operation would raise a `Layout` event.  \\n  \\n For more information about how to handle events, see [Events](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/b6f65241-e0ad-4590-a99f-200ce741bb1f).  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  Functions and objects in the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Compatibility.VB6> namespace are provided for use by the tools for upgrading from Visual Basic 6.0 to [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)].
