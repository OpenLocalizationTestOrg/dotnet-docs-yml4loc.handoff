Not exposing a <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty> identifier does not increase the security of your read-only dependency property in any way, it just makes operations that involve your property more awkward both for subsequent derived classes and class instances.  \\n  \\n To expose the  <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty> identifier on your class, you call <xref:System.Windows.DependencyPropertyKey.DependencyProperty%2A> directly on your key. Use this value to create a `public static readonly`<xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty> identifier on the class, which parallels the <xref:System.Windows.DependencyPropertyKey>.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following example calls <xref:System.Windows.DependencyPropertyKey.DependencyProperty%2A> to expose the <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty> identifier (`AquariumGraphicProperty`) for the `AquariumGraphic` read-only dependency property on a class. The example also shows the <xref:System.Windows.DependencyPropertyKey> creation (as an internal member) and the get accessor for `AquariumGraphic`.  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[WPFAquariumSln#RODP](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFAquariumSln/CSharp/WPFAquariumObjects/Class1.cs#rodp)]\\n [!code-vb[WPFAquariumSln#RODP](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFAquariumSln/visualbasic/wpfaquariumobjects/class1.vb#rodp)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public System.Windows.DependencyProperty DependencyProperty { get; }\n    return:\n      type: System.Windows.DependencyProperty\n      description: The relevant dependency property identifier.\n  overload: System.Windows.DependencyPropertyKey.DependencyProperty*\n  exceptions: []\n  version:\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  monikers:\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  content_git_url: https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/xml/System.Windows/DependencyPropertyKey.xml\n  ms.technology:\n  - dotnet-wpf\n  ms.author: kempb\n  manager: ghogen\n- uid: System.Windows.DependencyPropertyKey.OverrideMetadata(System.Type,System.Windows.PropertyMetadata)\n  commentId: M:System.Windows.DependencyPropertyKey.OverrideMetadata(System.Type,System.Windows.PropertyMetadata)\n  id: OverrideMetadata(System.Type,System.Windows.PropertyMetadata)\n  parent: System.Windows.DependencyPropertyKey\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: OverrideMetadata(Type, PropertyMetadata)\n  nameWithType: DependencyPropertyKey.OverrideMetadata(Type, PropertyMetadata)\n  fullName: DependencyPropertyKey.OverrideMetadata(Type, PropertyMetadata)\n  type: Method\n  assemblies:\n  - WindowsBase\n  namespace: System.Windows\n  summary: Overrides the metadata of a read-only dependency property that is represented by this dependency property identifier.\n  remarks: \"Overriding metadata on a read-only dependency property is done for similar reasons as overriding metadata on a read-write dependency property, and is restricted to access at the key level because behaviors specified in the metadata can change the set behavior (the default value, for instance).  \\n  \\n As with read-write dependency properties, overriding metadata on a read-only dependency property should only be done prior to that property being placed in use by the property system (this equates to the time that specific instances of objects that register the property are instantiated). Calls to <xref:System.Windows.DependencyPropertyKey.OverrideMetadata%2A> should only be performed within the static constructors of the type that provides itself as the `forType` parameter of this method, or equivalent initialization for that class.  \\n  \\n This method effectively forwards to the <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.OverrideMetadata%2A> method, passing the <xref:System.Windows.DependencyPropertyKey> instance as the key parameter.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following example overrides metadata for an existing read-only dependency property that a class inherits.
