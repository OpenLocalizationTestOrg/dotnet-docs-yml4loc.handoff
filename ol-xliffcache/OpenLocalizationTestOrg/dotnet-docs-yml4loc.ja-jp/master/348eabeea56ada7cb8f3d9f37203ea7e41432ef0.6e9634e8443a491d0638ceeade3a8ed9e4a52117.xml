The control triggers an event in server code that you can handle to respond to the postback. It can also raise an event in client script that you can handle before the page is posted or that can run and then cancel submission of the page.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  ASP.NET includes several kinds of button controls, each of which appears differently on Web pages. They are the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button> control, which renders as a push button; the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.LinkButton> control, which renders as a link; and the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.ImageButton> control, which renders as an image; and the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.ImageMap> control, which lets you create a graphic that has hotspots that users can click. By default, all button controls submit the page when clicked. You can also use the <xref:System.Web.UI.HtmlControls.HtmlButton> and <xref:System.Web.UI.HtmlControls.HtmlInputButton> controls to create buttons on the page that are programmable in server code. For details about the differences between HTML and Web server controls, see [ASP.NET Web Server Controls Overview](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/0d4854a3-6e79-4b7b-a27f-ac57cd9c2a84).  \n  \n By default, a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button> control is a Submit button. A Submit button does not have a command name (specified by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button.CommandName%2A> property) associated with the button and simply posts the Web page back to the server. You can provide an event handler for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button.Click> event to programmatically control the actions performed when the Submit button is clicked.  \n  \n A Command button has a command name associated with the button, such as `Sort`, by setting the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button.CommandName%2A> property. This allows you to create multiple <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button> controls on a Web page and programmatically determine which <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button> control is clicked. You can also use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button.CommandArgument%2A> property with a command button to provide additional information about the command to perform, such as `Ascending`. You can provide an event handler for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button.Command> event to programmatically control the actions performed when the Command button is clicked.  \n  \n<a name=\"ButtonPostbackBehaviorandServerEvents\"></a>   \n## Button Postback Behavior and Server Events  \n When a user clicks any Web server control button, the page is sent to the server. This causes the Web page to be processed and any pending events to be raised in server-based code. When all page and control processing has finished, the page renders itself to the browser again.  \n  \n The buttons can raise their own <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button.Click> events or <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button.Command> event, which you can handle by using server-based code. This is different than events in traditional HTML pages or in client-based Web applications, where a button's `onclick` event is handled by using JavaScript that runs in the client. For more information, see [ASP.NET Web Forms Server Control Event Model](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/6304bff7-1b0e-4641-8acb-6d3b0badc4a3).  \n  \n When users click a button control, the page is posted back to the server. By default, the page is posted back to itself,  \n  \n You can configure buttons to post the current page to another page. This can be useful for creating multi-page forms. For details, see [Cross-Page Posting in ASP.NET Web Forms](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/fedf234e-b7c4-4644-a9e8-c1c0870b043b).  \n  \n<a name=\"HandlingButtonEventsinClientScript\"></a>   \n## Handling Button Events in Client Script  \n Button controls can raise both server events and client events. Server events occur after postback, and they are handled in the server-side code that you write for the page. Client events are handled in client script, typically ECMAScript (JavaScript), and are raised before the page is submitted. By adding client-side events to ASP.NET button controls, you can perform tasks such as displaying confirmation dialog boxes before submitting the page, and potentially cancel the submission. For details, see [Client Script in ASP.NET Web Pages](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/13edb6b9-2dea-43c6-b8c1-a47207de19aa) and [How to: Respond to Button Web Server Control Events in Client Script](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/1ab97f0b-1c38-4897-85b0-ac915f6a182b).  \n  \n You might also want the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button> control to also use client script to perform the postback (instead of simply performing an HTTP POST operation). This can be useful if you want to programmatically manipulate the postback, such as attaching it to other elements on the page. You can set the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button> control's <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button.UseSubmitBehavior%2A> property to `true` to cause the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button> control to use client-script based postback.  \n  \n<a name=\"ButtonControlsAndValidation\"></a>   \n## Button Controls and Validation  \n If a page contains ASP.NET validator controls, by default, clicking a button control causes the validator control to perform its check. If client-side validation is enabled for a validator control, the page is not submitted if a validation check has failed.  \n  \n The following table describes the properties supported by button controls that enable you to control the validation process more precisely.  \n  \n|Property|Description|  \n|--------------|-----------------|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button.CausesValidation%2A>|Specifies whether clicking the button also performs a validation check. Set this property to `false` to prevent a validation check.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button.ValidationGroup%2A>|Enables you to specify which validators on the page are called when the button is clicked. If no validation groups are established, a button click calls all of the validators that are on the page.|  \n  \n For more information, see [Validating User Input in ASP.NET Web Pages](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/4ad3dacb-89e0-4cee-89ac-40a3f2a85461).  \n  \n<a name=\"ButtonsInDataControls\"></a>   \n## Buttons in Data Controls  \n Button Web server controls are often used in data controls, such as in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.DataList>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Repeater> list controls. In those cases, you typically do not respond directly to the button click event. Instead, a button in a data control raises an event that is specific to the data control. For example, in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.DataList> control, a button might raise the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.DataList> control's <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.DataList.ItemCommand> event instead of raising the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button> control's <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button.Click> event.  \n  \n Because data-bound list controls can contain many buttons, you can set the button's <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button.CommandArgument%2A> property to specify a value to pass as part of the event. You can then test for this argument to see which button was clicked.  \n  \n<a name=\"BindingDataToTheControls\"></a>   \n## Binding Data to the Controls  \n You can bind the button Web server controls to a data source in order to control their property settings dynamically. For example, you can set a button's <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button.Text%2A> property by using data binding.  \n  \n<a name=\"UsingButtonsWithUpdatePanelControls\"></a>   \n## Using Buttons with UpdatePanel Controls  \n Partial-page rendering makes it possible to refresh portions of a page without a postback. <xref:System.Web.UI.UpdatePanel> controls enable you to mark parts of the page that participate in partial-page rendering. By default, the behavior of controls inside an <xref:System.Web.UI.UpdatePanel> control, including <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button> controls, is to perform an asynchronous postback instead of a postback. This refreshes only the contents of the <xref:System.Web.UI.UpdatePanel> control from which the postback originates.  \n  \n In addition to the scenario of a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button> control that is inside an <xref:System.Web.UI.UpdatePanel> control, you can use <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button> controls with <xref:System.Web.UI.UpdatePanel> controls in the following scenarios:  \n  \n-   Defining a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button> control that is outside an <xref:System.Web.UI.UpdatePanel> control as an <xref:System.Web.UI.AsyncPostBackTrigger> control for that panel. When the button is clicked, it performs an asynchronous postback and refreshes the contents of the panel.  \n  \n-   Defining a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button> control that is inside an <xref:System.Web.UI.UpdatePanel> control as a <xref:System.Web.UI.PostBackTrigger> for the panel. When the button is clicked, it performs a postback even though it is inside an <xref:System.Web.UI.UpdatePanel> control.  \n  \n For more information about partial-page rendering and using <xref:System.Web.UI.UpdatePanel> controls, see [UpdatePanel Control Overview](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/29a2265d-9674-4c19-b70e-e5560ee9689a) and [Partial-Page Rendering Overview](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/5c12736d-d9e9-464a-9388-3fe0f9f49e49).  \n  \n<a name=\"DeclarativeSyntax\"></a>   \n## Declarative Syntax  \n  \n```  \n<asp:Button  \n    AccessKey=\"string\"  \n    BackColor=\"color name|#dddddd\"  \n    BorderColor=\"color name|#dddddd\"  \n    BorderStyle=\"NotSet|None|Dotted|Dashed|Solid|Double|Groove|Ridge|  \n        Inset|Outset\"  \n    BorderWidth=\"size\"  \n    CausesValidation=\"True|False\"  \n    CommandArgument=\"string\"  \n    CommandName=\"string\"  \n    CssClass=\"string\"  \n    Enabled=\"True|False\"  \n    EnableTheming=\"True|False\"  \n    EnableViewState=\"True|False\"  \n    Font-Bold=\"True|False\"  \n    Font-Italic=\"True|False\"  \n    Font-Names=\"string\"  \n    Font-Overline=\"True|False\"  \n    Font-Size=\"string|Smaller|Larger|XX-Small|X-Small|Small|Medium|  \n        Large|X-Large|XX-Large\"  \n    Font-Strikeout=\"True|False\"  \n    Font-Underline=\"True|False\"  \n    ForeColor=\"color name|#dddddd\"  \n    Height=\"size\"  \n    ID=\"string\"  \n    OnClick=\"Click event handler\"  \n    OnClientClick=\"string\"  \n    OnCommand=\"Command event handler\"  \n    OnDataBinding=\"DataBinding event handler\"  \n    OnDisposed=\"Disposed event handler\"  \n    OnInit=\"Init event handler\"  \n    OnLoad=\"Load event handler\"  \n    OnPreRender=\"PreRender event handler\"  \n    OnUnload=\"Unload event handler\"  \n    PostBackUrl=\"uri\"  \n    runat=\"server\"  \n    SkinID=\"string\"  \n    Style=\"string\"  \n    TabIndex=\"integer\"  \n    Text=\"string\"  \n    ToolTip=\"string\"  \n    UseSubmitBehavior=\"True|False\"  \n    ValidationGroup=\"string\"  \n    Visible=\"True|False\"  \n    Width=\"size\"  \n/>  \n```","nodes":[{"pos":[0,14],"content":"In this topic:","nodes":[{"content":"In this topic:","pos":[0,14]}]},{"pos":[24,53],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Introduction<ept id=\"p1\">](#Introduction)</ept>","source":"[Introduction](#Introduction)"},{"pos":[63,147],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Button Postback Behavior and Server Events<ept id=\"p1\">](#ButtonPostbackBehaviorandServerEvents)</ept>","source":"[Button Postback Behavior and Server Events](#ButtonPostbackBehaviorandServerEvents)"},{"pos":[157,235],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Handling Button Events in Client Script<ept id=\"p1\">](#HandlingButtonEventsinClientScript)</ept>","source":"[Handling Button Events in Client Script](#HandlingButtonEventsinClientScript)"},{"pos":[245,307],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Button Controls and Validation<ept id=\"p1\">](#ButtonControlsAndValidation)</ept>","source":"[Button Controls and Validation](#ButtonControlsAndValidation)"},{"pos":[317,367],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Buttons in Data Controls<ept id=\"p1\">](#ButtonsInDataControls)</ept>","source":"[Buttons in Data Controls](#ButtonsInDataControls)"},{"pos":[377,434],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Binding Data to the Controls<ept id=\"p1\">](#BindingDataToTheControls)</ept>","source":"[Binding Data to the Controls](#BindingDataToTheControls)"},{"pos":[444,523],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Using Buttons with UpdatePanel Controls<ept id=\"p1\">](#UsingButtonsWithUpdatePanelControls)</ept>","source":"[Using Buttons with UpdatePanel Controls](#UsingButtonsWithUpdatePanelControls)"},{"pos":[533,573],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Declarative Syntax<ept id=\"p1\">](#DeclarativeSyntax)</ept>","source":"[Declarative Syntax](#DeclarativeSyntax)"},{"pos":[613,625],"content":"Introduction","linkify":"Introduction","nodes":[{"content":"Introduction","pos":[0,12]}]},{"pos":[629,1009],"content":"Use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button> control to create a push button on the Web page that lets users to post a page to the server.

The control triggers an event in server code that you can handle to respond to the postback. It can also raise an event in client script that you can handle before the page is posted or that can run and then cancel submission of the page.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  ASP.NET includes several kinds of button controls, each of which appears differently on Web pages. They are the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button> control, which renders as a push button; the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.LinkButton> control, which renders as a link; and the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.ImageButton> control, which renders as an image; and the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.ImageMap> control, which lets you create a graphic that has hotspots that users can click. By default, all button controls submit the page when clicked. You can also use the <xref:System.Web.UI.HtmlControls.HtmlButton> and <xref:System.Web.UI.HtmlControls.HtmlInputButton> controls to create buttons on the page that are programmable in server code. For details about the differences between HTML and Web server controls, see [ASP.NET Web Server Controls Overview](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/0d4854a3-6e79-4b7b-a27f-ac57cd9c2a84).  \\n  \\n By default, a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button> control is a Submit button. A Submit button does not have a command name (specified by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button.CommandName%2A> property) associated with the button and simply posts the Web page back to the server. You can provide an event handler for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button.Click> event to programmatically control the actions performed when the Submit button is clicked.  \\n  \\n A Command button has a command name associated with the button, such as `Sort`, by setting the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button.CommandName%2A> property. This allows you to create multiple <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button> controls on a Web page and programmatically determine which <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button> control is clicked. You can also use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button.CommandArgument%2A> property with a command button to provide additional information about the command to perform, such as `Ascending`. You can provide an event handler for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button.Command> event to programmatically control the actions performed when the Command button is clicked.  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"ButtonPostbackBehaviorandServerEvents\\\"></a>   \\n## Button Postback Behavior and Server Events  \\n When a user clicks any Web server control button, the page is sent to the server. This causes the Web page to be processed and any pending events to be raised in server-based code. When all page and control processing has finished, the page renders itself to the browser again.  \\n  \\n The buttons can raise their own <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button.Click> events or <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button.Command> event, which you can handle by using server-based code. This is different than events in traditional HTML pages or in client-based Web applications, where a button's `onclick` event is handled by using JavaScript that runs in the client. For more information, see [ASP.NET Web Forms Server Control Event Model](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/6304bff7-1b0e-4641-8acb-6d3b0badc4a3).  \\n  \\n When users click a button control, the page is posted back to the server. By default, the page is posted back to itself,  \\n  \\n You can configure buttons to post the current page to another page. This can be useful for creating multi-page forms. For details, see [Cross-Page Posting in ASP.NET Web Forms](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/fedf234e-b7c4-4644-a9e8-c1c0870b043b).  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"HandlingButtonEventsinClientScript\\\"></a>   \\n## Handling Button Events in Client Script  \\n Button controls can raise both server events and client events. Server events occur after postback, and they are handled in the server-side code that you write for the page. Client events are handled in client script, typically ECMAScript (JavaScript), and are raised before the page is submitted. By adding client-side events to ASP.NET button controls, you can perform tasks such as displaying confirmation dialog boxes before submitting the page, and potentially cancel the submission. For details, see [Client Script in ASP.NET Web Pages](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/13edb6b9-2dea-43c6-b8c1-a47207de19aa) and [How to: Respond to Button Web Server Control Events in Client Script](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/1ab97f0b-1c38-4897-85b0-ac915f6a182b).  \\n  \\n You might also want the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button> control to also use client script to perform the postback (instead of simply performing an HTTP POST operation). This can be useful if you want to programmatically manipulate the postback, such as attaching it to other elements on the page. You can set the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button> control's <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button.UseSubmitBehavior%2A> property to `true` to cause the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button> control to use client-script based postback.  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"ButtonControlsAndValidation\\\"></a>   \\n## Button Controls and Validation  \\n If a page contains ASP.NET validator controls, by default, clicking a button control causes the validator control to perform its check. If client-side validation is enabled for a validator control, the page is not submitted if a validation check has failed.  \\n  \\n The following table describes the properties supported by button controls that enable you to control the validation process more precisely.  \\n  \\n|Property|Description|  \\n|--------------|-----------------|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button.CausesValidation%2A>|Specifies whether clicking the button also performs a validation check. Set this property to `false` to prevent a validation check.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button.ValidationGroup%2A>|Enables you to specify which validators on the page are called when the button is clicked. If no validation groups are established, a button click calls all of the validators that are on the page.|  \\n  \\n For more information, see [Validating User Input in ASP.NET Web Pages](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/4ad3dacb-89e0-4cee-89ac-40a3f2a85461).  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"ButtonsInDataControls\\\"></a>   \\n## Buttons in Data Controls  \\n Button Web server controls are often used in data controls, such as in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.DataList>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Repeater> list controls. In those cases, you typically do not respond directly to the button click event. Instead, a button in a data control raises an event that is specific to the data control. For example, in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.DataList> control, a button might raise the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.DataList> control's <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.DataList.ItemCommand> event instead of raising the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button> control's <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button.Click> event.  \\n  \\n Because data-bound list controls can contain many buttons, you can set the button's <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button.CommandArgument%2A> property to specify a value to pass as part of the event. You can then test for this argument to see which button was clicked.  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"BindingDataToTheControls\\\"></a>   \\n## Binding Data to the Controls  \\n You can bind the button Web server controls to a data source in order to control their property settings dynamically. For example, you can set a button's <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button.Text%2A> property by using data binding.  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"UsingButtonsWithUpdatePanelControls\\\"></a>   \\n## Using Buttons with UpdatePanel Controls  \\n Partial-page rendering makes it possible to refresh portions of a page without a postback. <xref:System.Web.UI.UpdatePanel> controls enable you to mark parts of the page that participate in partial-page rendering. By default, the behavior of controls inside an <xref:System.Web.UI.UpdatePanel> control, including <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button> controls, is to perform an asynchronous postback instead of a postback. This refreshes only the contents of the <xref:System.Web.UI.UpdatePanel> control from which the postback originates.  \\n  \\n In addition to the scenario of a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button> control that is inside an <xref:System.Web.UI.UpdatePanel> control, you can use <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button> controls with <xref:System.Web.UI.UpdatePanel> controls in the following scenarios:  \\n  \\n-   Defining a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button> control that is outside an <xref:System.Web.UI.UpdatePanel> control as an <xref:System.Web.UI.AsyncPostBackTrigger> control for that panel. When the button is clicked, it performs an asynchronous postback and refreshes the contents of the panel.  \\n  \\n-   Defining a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button> control that is inside an <xref:System.Web.UI.UpdatePanel> control as a <xref:System.Web.UI.PostBackTrigger> for the panel. When the button is clicked, it performs a postback even though it is inside an <xref:System.Web.UI.UpdatePanel> control.  \\n  \\n For more information about partial-page rendering and using <xref:System.Web.UI.UpdatePanel> controls, see [UpdatePanel Control Overview](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/29a2265d-9674-4c19-b70e-e5560ee9689a) and [Partial-Page Rendering Overview](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/5c12736d-d9e9-464a-9388-3fe0f9f49e49).  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"DeclarativeSyntax\\\"></a>   \\n## Declarative Syntax  \\n  \\n```  \\n<asp:Button  \\n    AccessKey=\\\"string\\\"  \\n    BackColor=\\\"color name|#dddddd\\\"  \\n    BorderColor=\\\"color name|#dddddd\\\"  \\n    BorderStyle=\\\"NotSet|None|Dotted|Dashed|Solid|Double|Groove|Ridge|  \\n        Inset|Outset\\\"  \\n    BorderWidth=\\\"size\\\"  \\n    CausesValidation=\\\"True|False\\\"  \\n    CommandArgument=\\\"string\\\"  \\n    CommandName=\\\"string\\\"  \\n    CssClass=\\\"string\\\"  \\n    Enabled=\\\"True|False\\\"  \\n    EnableTheming=\\\"True|False\\\"  \\n    EnableViewState=\\\"True|False\\\"  \\n    Font-Bold=\\\"True|False\\\"  \\n    Font-Italic=\\\"True|False\\\"  \\n    Font-Names=\\\"string\\\"  \\n    Font-Overline=\\\"True|False\\\"  \\n    Font-Size=\\\"string|Smaller|Larger|XX-Small|X-Small|Small|Medium|  \\n        Large|X-Large|XX-Large\\\"  \\n    Font-Strikeout=\\\"True|False\\\"  \\n    Font-Underline=\\\"True|False\\\"  \\n    ForeColor=\\\"color name|#dddddd\\\"  \\n    Height=\\\"size\\\"  \\n    ID=\\\"string\\\"  \\n    OnClick=\\\"Click event handler\\\"  \\n    OnClientClick=\\\"string\\\"  \\n    OnCommand=\\\"Command event handler\\\"  \\n    OnDataBinding=\\\"DataBinding event handler\\\"  \\n    OnDisposed=\\\"Disposed event handler\\\"  \\n    OnInit=\\\"Init event handler\\\"  \\n    OnLoad=\\\"Load event handler\\\"  \\n    OnPreRender=\\\"PreRender event handler\\\"  \\n    OnUnload=\\\"Unload event handler\\\"  \\n    PostBackUrl=\\\"uri\\\"  \\n    runat=\\\"server\\\"  \\n    SkinID=\\\"string\\\"  \\n    Style=\\\"string\\\"  \\n    TabIndex=\\\"integer\\\"  \\n    Text=\\\"string\\\"  \\n    ToolTip=\\\"string\\\"  \\n    UseSubmitBehavior=\\\"True|False\\\"  \\n    ValidationGroup=\\\"string\\\"  \\n    Visible=\\\"True|False\\\"  \\n    Width=\\\"size\\\"  \\n/>  \\n```\"\n  example:\n  -
