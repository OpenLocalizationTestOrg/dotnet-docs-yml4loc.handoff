the rendering for only the selected sections of <xref href=\"System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart\"></xref> or server controls in a <xref href=\"System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase\"></xref> zone.\n  remarks: \"Web Parts chrome refers to the peripheral user interface (UI) elements that frame each <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control or server control contained in a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> zone. The chrome for a control includes its border, its title bar, and the icons, title text, and verbs menu that appear within the title bar. The appearance of the chrome is set at the zone level, and applies to all the server controls in the zone.  \\n  \\n The Web Parts control set uses the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartChrome> class to render the chrome for <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls. Additionally, this class provides a way for developers to customize the rendering of any individual section (such as the header or footer) of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls in a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> zone without having to handle all the rendering for those controls. For example, you can override the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartChrome.CreateWebPartChromeStyle%2A> method to customize some specific style attributes applied to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> zone, but you can rely on the default rendering to handle the rest.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartChrome> class contains several important methods that are useful when you want to override the rendering of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls. One is the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartChrome.CreateWebPartChromeStyle%2A> method, which enables you to change the style attributes of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Style> object associated with the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartChrome> object used to render a control. Another is the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartChrome.%23ctor%2A> constructor, which you use when you override the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.CreateWebPartChrome%2A> method in a custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> class to create an instance of your custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartChrome> object. Another useful method is the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartChrome.RenderPartContents%2A> method, which you can use to control the rendering of the content area of controls in a zone (as opposed to chrome elements such as headers, footers, and title bars). The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartChrome.GetWebPartVerbs%2A> method enables you to exclude certain verbs from being rendered, if for some reason you do not want users to see those verbs in the UI. Finally, if you want complete programmatic control over all aspects of rendering the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, you can override the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartChrome.RenderWebPart%2A> method.  \\n  \\n Several properties of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartChrome> class are also useful. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartChrome.Zone%2A> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartChrome.WebPartManager%2A> properties provide references to the zone associated with the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartChrome> object and the current <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> instance, respectively.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example demonstrates how to use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartChrome> class to override the default rendering of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls in a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> zone.  \\n  \\n The code example has four parts:  \\n  \\n-   A user control that enables you to change display modes on a Web Parts page.  \\n  \\n-   A Web page that hosts all the controls in the example.  \\n  \\n-   A class that contains the source code for a custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> zone and a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartChrome> class.  \\n  \\n-   An explanation of how the example works.  \\n  \\n The first part of the code example is the user control. The source code for the user control comes from another topic. For this code example to work, you need to obtain the .ascx file for the user control from the [Walkthrough: Changing Display Modes on a Web Parts Page](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/24e42f74-82dc-4c13-8574-130398985fc0) topic, and place the file in the same folder as the .aspx page in this code example.  \\n  \\n The second part of the example is the Web page. Note that there is a `Register` directive near the top of the file to register the compiled component and a tag prefix. Also note that the page references the custom zone using the element `<aspSample:MyZone>` and includes several standard ASP.NET server controls within the zone. The server controls do not implement any actual functionality; they are used here only to illustrate how the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartChrome> class features apply to rendering zones. Note that these server controls, though they are not actual <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, are each automatically wrapped (by ASP.NET) with a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart> object at run time, so they will have the same functionality as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls.  \\n  \\n <!-- TODO: review snippet reference [!code-csharp[WebParts_WebPartChrome_Overview#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_WebPartChrome_Overview/CS/webpartchromecs.aspx#1)]  -->\\n <!-- TODO: review snippet reference [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartChrome_Overview#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_WebPartChrome_Overview/VB/webpartchromevb.aspx#1)]  -->  \\n  \\n The third part of the code example is the source for the custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> zone and a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartChrome> class. In the constructor for the custom zone class, the code checks the `MyZone.RenderVerbsInMenu` property. If the value is `true`, verbs are rendered in a menu for each of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls in the zone. This is the normal, default behavior in the Web Parts controls set. If the `MyZone.RenderVerbsInMenu` property value is `false`, which is the default in this custom zone, the verbs are rendered individually as links in the title bar of each control. Notice that in the Web page code where the `<aspSample:MyZone>` element is declared, there is a `RenderVerbsInMenu` attribute set to `true`, so that the verbs will appear in menus on the controls. To experiment with this feature, you can set the declarative `RenderVerbsInMenu` attribute to `false`, and note how the verbs are rendered as links.  \\n  \\n The custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartChrome> class overrides the rendering on several methods, and the custom zone creates an instance of the `MyWebPartChrome` class in its <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.CreateWebPartChrome%2A> method. This applies the custom rendering to the page. For the code example to run, you must compile this source code. You can compile it explicitly and put the resulting assembly in your Web site's Bin folder or the global assembly cache. Alternatively, you can put the source code in your site's App_Code folder, where it will be dynamically compiled at run time. For a walkthrough that demonstrates both methods of compiling, see [Walkthrough: Developing and Using a Custom Web Server Control](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/6d90782a-a1a4-45a6-b2d4-cf6362b83b08).  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[WebParts_WebPartChrome_Overview#2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_WebPartChrome_Overview/CS/MyChrome.cs#2)]\\n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartChrome_Overview#2](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_WebPartChrome_Overview/VB/MyChrome.vb#2)]  \\n  \\n When you load the Web page in a browser, you can see how the various stylistic and other rendering customizations made in the source code of the `MyWebPartChrome` class appear on the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls rendered in the zone.\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public class WebPartChrome\n  inheritance:\n  - System.Object\n  implements: []\n  inheritedMembers:\n  - System.Object.Equals(System.Object)\n  - System.Object.Equals(System.Object,System.Object)\n  - System.Object.GetHashCode\n  - System.Object.GetType\n  - System.Object.MemberwiseClone\n  - System.Object.ReferenceEquals(System.Object,System.Object)\n  - System.Object.ToString\n  version:\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  monikers:\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  content_git_url: https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/xml/System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts/WebPartChrome.xml\n  ms.technology:\n  - dotnet-webforms\n  author: tdykstra\n  ms.author: tdykstra\n  manager: wpickett\n- uid: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartChrome.#ctor(System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase,System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager)\n  commentId: M:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartChrome.#ctor(System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase,System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager)\n  id: '#ctor(System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase,System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager)'\n  parent: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartChrome\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: WebPartChrome(WebPartZoneBase, WebPartManager)\n  nameWithType: WebPartChrome.WebPartChrome(WebPartZoneBase, WebPartManager)\n  fullName: WebPartChrome.WebPartChrome(WebPartZoneBase, WebPartManager)\n  type: Constructor\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Web\n  namespace: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts\n  summary: Initializes a new instance of the control.\n  remarks: The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartChrome.%23ctor%2A> initializes a new instance of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartChrome> class.

Second, in the constructor of the `MyWebPartChrome` class, it assigns the objects in the parameters of the constructor to private fields that can be used within the class. This example thus gives you a way to access the associated zone and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> object even in the constructor, before the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartChrome.Zone%2A> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartChrome.WebPartManager%2A> properties are accessible. Finally, note that for the constructor to work, the base constructor must also be invoked as part of the method declaration.  \\n  \\n The following code contains the two custom classes.
