System.Windows.Forms\n  namespace: System.Windows.Forms\n  summary: Represents a Windows combo box control.\n  remarks: \"A <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox> displays a text box combined with a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListBox>, which enables the user to select items from the list or enter a new value.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox.DropDownStyle%2A> property specifies whether the list is always displayed or whether the list is displayed in a drop-down. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox.DropDownStyle%2A> property also specifies whether the text portion can be edited. See <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBoxStyle> for the available settings and their effects. There is no setting to always display the list and disallow entering a new value. To display a list to which no new values can be added, use a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListBox> control.  \\n  \\n To add or remove objects in the list at run time, use methods of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox.ObjectCollection> class (through the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox.Items%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox>). You can assign an array of object references with the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox.ObjectCollection.AddRange%2A> method. The list then displays the default string value for each object. You can add individual objects with the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox.ObjectCollection.Add%2A> method. You can delete items with the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox.ObjectCollection.Remove%2A> method or clear the entire list with the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox.ObjectCollection.Clear%2A> method.  \\n  \\n In addition to display and selection functionality, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox> also provides features that enable you to efficiently add items to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox> and to find text within the items of the list. With the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox.BeginUpdate%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox.EndUpdate%2A> methods, you can add a large number of items to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox> without the control being repainted each time an item is added to the list. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox.FindString%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox.FindStringExact%2A> methods enable you to search for an item in the list that contains a specific search string.  \\n  \\n You can use these properties to manage the currently selected item in the list, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox.Text%2A> property to specify the string displayed in the editing field, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox.SelectedIndex%2A> property to get or set the current item, and the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox.SelectedItem%2A> property to get or set a reference to the object.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  If you have a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListBox>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox>, or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CheckedListBox> on a base Windows Forms page and want to modify the string collections of those controls in a derived form, the string collections of those controls in the base form must be empty. If the string collections are not empty, they become read-only when you derive another form.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example is a complete application showing how you can use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox.ObjectCollection.Add%2A> method to add items to a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox>, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox.FindString%2A> method to find items in a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox>, and the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox.BeginUpdate%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox.EndUpdate%2A> methods to efficiently add a large number items to a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox>. The ability to store values that are different from displayed text is inherited from <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListControl>. For an example of how to use this feature, see the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListControl> class.  \\n  \\n You must add references to the `System.Drawing` and `System.Windows.Forms` namespaces to run this example.  \\n  \\n [!code-cpp[ComboBox#1](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/ComboBox/CPP/comboboxtype.cpp#1)]\\n [!code-csharp[ComboBox#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/ComboBox/CS/comboboxtype.cs#1)]\\n [!code-vb[ComboBox#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/ComboBox/VB/comboboxtype.vb#1)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: >-\n      [System.ComponentModel.DefaultBindingProperty(\"Text\")]\n\n      [System.Runtime.InteropServices.ClassInterface(System.Runtime.InteropServices.ClassInterfaceType.AutoDispatch)]\n\n      [System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComVisible(true)]\n\n      public class ComboBox : System.Windows.Forms.ListControl\n  inheritance:\n  -

However, if you want to add items one at a time using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox.ObjectCollection.Add%2A> method of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox.ObjectCollection> class, you can use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox.BeginUpdate%2A> method to prevent the control from repainting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox> each time an item is added to the list.
