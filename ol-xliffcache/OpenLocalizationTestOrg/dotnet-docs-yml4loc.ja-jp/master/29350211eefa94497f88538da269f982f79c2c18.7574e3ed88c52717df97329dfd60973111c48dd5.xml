When the content of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollViewer> is not entirely visible, the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollViewer> displays scrollbars that the user can use to move the content areas that is visible.  The area that includes all of the content of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollViewer> is the extent.  The visible area of the content is the viewport.  \\n  \\n Physical scrolling is used to scroll content by a predetermined physical increment, typically by a value that is declared in pixels. Logical scrolling is used to scroll to the next item in the logical tree. If you require physical scrolling instead of logical scrolling, wrap the host <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel> element in a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollViewer> and set its <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollViewer.CanContentScroll%2A> property to `false`. Physical scrolling is the default scroll behavior for most <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel> elements.  \\n  \\n If your <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollViewer> contains a large number of items, the scrolling performance may be affected.  In this case, set <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollViewer.IsDeferredScrollingEnabled%2A> to `true`.  This causes the content view to remain static while dragging the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Thumb> and to update only when the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Thumb> is released.  \\n  \\n Because the scroll bars for a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollViewer> element are defined in the default style of the element, scroll bars will no longer appear if you apply a custom style to a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollViewer>. Scroll bars must be defined in the custom style for them to appear.  \\n  \\n## Customizing the ScrollViewer Control  \\n To apply the same property settings to multiple <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollViewer> controls, use the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Style%2A> property. You can modify the default <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ControlTemplate> to give the control a unique appearance. For more information about creating a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ControlTemplate>, see [Customizing the Appearance of an Existing Control by Creating a ControlTemplate](~/docs/framework/wpf/controls/customizing-the-appearance-of-an-existing-control.md).  To see the parts and states that are specific to the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollViewer>, see [ScrollViewer Styles and Templates](~/docs/framework/wpf/controls/scrollviewer-styles-and-templates.md).  \\n  \\n Dependency properties for this control might be set by the control’s default style.  If a property is set by a default style, the property might change from its default value when the control appears in the application. The default style is determined by which desktop theme is used when the application is running.  For more information, see [Default WPF Themes](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=158252).  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  Setting a visual property will only have an effect if that property is both present in <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollViewer> control's default template and is set by using a . You can find a list of visual properties in the \\\"Changing the Visual Structure of a Control\\\" section in [Customizing the Appearance of an Existing Control by Creating a ControlTemplate](~/docs/framework/wpf/controls/customizing-the-appearance-of-an-existing-control.md).\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following example creates a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollViewer> that contains some text and a rectangle. The scroll bars appear only when they are needed.
