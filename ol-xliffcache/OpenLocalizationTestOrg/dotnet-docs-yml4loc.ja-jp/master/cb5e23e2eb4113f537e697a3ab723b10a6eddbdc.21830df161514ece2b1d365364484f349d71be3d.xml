The <xref:System.Net.NetworkInformation.Ping.Send%2A> and <xref:System.Net.NetworkInformation.Ping.SendAsync%2A> methods send an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request message to a remote computer and waits for an ICMP echo reply message from that computer.

Specifying `buffer` allows you to learn the amount of time required for a packet of a particular size to travel to and from the remote host and the maximum transmission unit of the network path.

The presence and configuration of proxies, network address translation (NAT) equipment, or firewalls can prevent <xref:System.Net.NetworkInformation.Ping> from succeeding. A successful <xref:System.Net.NetworkInformation.Ping> indicates only that the remote host can be reached on the network; the presence of higher level services (such as a Web server) on the remote host is not guaranteed.  \\n  \\n This class provides functionality similar to the Ping.exe command line tool. The <xref:System.Net.NetworkInformation.Ping.Send%2A> and <xref:System.Net.NetworkInformation.Ping.SendAsync%2A> methods send an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request message to a remote computer and waits for an ICMP echo reply message from that computer. For a detailed description of ICMP messages, see RFC 792, available at [http://www.ietf.org](http://www.ietf.org/).  \\n  \\n The following types are used with the <xref:System.Net.NetworkInformation.Ping> class and are described in detail below.  \\n  \\n|**Type name**|**Description**|  \\n|-------------------|---------------------|  \\n|<xref:System.Net.NetworkInformation.IPStatus>|Defines status codes that describe the outcome of an ICMP echo request message.|  \\n|<xref:System.Net.NetworkInformation.PingOptions>|Allows you to configure or retrieve the settings that control how many times the request packet can be forwarded (<xref:System.Net.NetworkInformation.PingOptions.Ttl%2A>), and whether it can be fragmented (<xref:System.Net.NetworkInformation.PingOptions.DontFragment%2A> ).|  \\n|<xref:System.Net.NetworkInformation.PingReply>|Contains the results of an ICMP echo request.|  \\n|<xref:System.Net.NetworkInformation.PingException>|Thrown if an unrecoverable error occurs.|  \\n|<xref:System.Net.NetworkInformation.PingCompletedEventArgs>|Contains the data associated with <xref:System.Net.NetworkInformation.Ping.PingCompleted> events, which are raised when a <xref:System.Net.NetworkInformation.Ping.SendAsync%2A> call completes or is canceled.|  \\n|<xref:System.Net.NetworkInformation.PingCompletedEventHandler>|The delegate that provides the callback method invoked when a <xref:System.Net.NetworkInformation.Ping.SendAsync%2A> call completes or is canceled.|  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Net.NetworkInformation.Ping.Send%2A> and <xref:System.Net.NetworkInformation.Ping.SendAsync%2A> methods return the reply in a <xref:System.Net.NetworkInformation.PingReply> object. The <xref:System.Net.NetworkInformation.PingReply.Status%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property returns an <xref:System.Net.NetworkInformation.IPStatus> value to indicate the outcome of the request.  \\n  \\n When sending the request, you must specify the remote computer. You can do this by providing a host name string, an IP address in string format, or an <xref:System.Net.IPAddress> object.  \\n  \\n You can also specify any of the following types of information:  \\n  \\n-   Data to accompany the request. Specifying `buffer` allows you to learn the amount of time required for a packet of a particular size to travel to and from the remote host and the maximum transmission unit of the network path. (See the <xref:System.Net.NetworkInformation.Ping.Send%2A> or <xref:System.Net.NetworkInformation.Ping.SendAsync%2A> overloads that take a `buffer` parameter.)  \\n  \\n-   Whether the ICMP Echo packet can be fragmented in transit. (See the <xref:System.Net.NetworkInformation.PingOptions.DontFragment%2A> property and the <xref:System.Net.NetworkInformation.Ping.Send%2A> or <xref:System.Net.NetworkInformation.Ping.SendAsync%2A> overloads that take an `options` parameter.)  \\n  \\n-   How many times routing nodes, such as routers or gateways, can forward the packet before it either reaches the destination computer or is discarded. (See <xref:System.Net.NetworkInformation.PingOptions.Ttl%2A> and the <xref:System.Net.NetworkInformation.Ping.Send%2A> or <xref:System.Net.NetworkInformation.Ping.SendAsync%2A> overloads that take an `options` parameter.)  \\n  \\n-   The time limit within which the reply must be received. (See the <xref:System.Net.NetworkInformation.Ping.Send%2A> or <xref:System.Net.NetworkInformation.Ping.SendAsync%2A> overloads that take a `timeout` parameter.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Net.NetworkInformation.Ping> class offers both synchronous and asynchronous methods for sending the request. If your application should block while waiting for a reply, use the <xref:System.Net.NetworkInformation.Ping.Send%2A> methods; these methods are synchronous. If your application should not block, use the asynchronous <xref:System.Net.NetworkInformation.Ping.SendAsync%2A> methods. A call to <xref:System.Net.NetworkInformation.Ping.SendAsync%2A> executes in its own thread that is automatically allocated from the thread pool. When the asynchronous operation completes, it raises the <xref:System.Net.NetworkInformation.Ping.PingCompleted> event. Applications use a <xref:System.Net.NetworkInformation.PingCompletedEventHandler> delegate to specify the method that is called for <xref:System.Net.NetworkInformation.Ping.PingCompleted> events. You must add a <xref:System.Net.NetworkInformation.PingCompletedEventHandler> delegate to the event before calling <xref:System.Net.NetworkInformation.Ping.SendAsync%2A>.
