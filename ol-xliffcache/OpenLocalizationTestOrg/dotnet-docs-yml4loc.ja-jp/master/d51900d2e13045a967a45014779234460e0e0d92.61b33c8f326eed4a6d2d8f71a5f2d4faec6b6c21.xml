The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control> class defines very little behavior; while it is possible to add a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control> to your application, it is far more common to add a control that inherits from <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control>, such as a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> or <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ListBox>.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.Template%2A> property, which is a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ControlTemplate>, specifies the appearance of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control>. If you want to change the appearance of a control but retain its functionality, you should consider creating a new <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ControlTemplate> instead of creating a new class. For more information, see [Styling and Templating](~/docs/framework/wpf/controls/styling-and-templating.md).  \\n  \\n If you want to create a control with custom behavior as well as allow others to customize its appearance, your control can inherit from the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control> class and define a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ControlTemplate>.  If you want to extend the behavior of an existing control, you can inherit from a class that inherits from <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control>.  \\n  \\n A <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control> that does not have a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ControlTemplate> is not visible in your application, and setting the following properties has no effect unless the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ControlTemplate> references them explicitly:  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.Background%2A>  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.BorderBrush%2A>  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.BorderThickness%2A>  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.FontFamily%2A>  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.FontSize%2A>  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.FontStretch%2A>  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.FontWeight%2A>  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.Foreground%2A>  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.HorizontalContentAlignment%2A>  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.VerticalContentAlignment%2A>  \\n  \\n A common way to use these properties is to bind an element in the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ControlTemplate> to the property.  For example, if you want your control to change color according to the value of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.Background%2A> property, you can bind some property of an element in the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ControlTemplate> to the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.Background%2A>. Use the [TemplateBinding Markup Extension](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/templatebinding-markup-extension.md) to bind properties on a control to an element in the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ControlTemplate>.  \\n  \\n <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control> overrides the metadata of the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Focusable%2A> property and sets its default to `true`.
