This usually occurs because a pointer has a bad value. Not all reads or writes through bad pointers lead to access violations, so an access violation usually indicates that several reads or writes have occurred through bad pointers, and that memory might be corrupted.

Any operation that attempts to reference a null reference in verifiable code throws a <xref:System.NullReferenceException> exception. An <xref:System.AccessViolationException> occurs only when verifiable managed code interacts with unmanaged code or with unsafe managed code.  \n  \n## Troubleshooting AccessViolationException exceptions  \n An <xref:System.AccessViolationException> exception can occur only in unsafe managed code or when verifiable managed code interacts with unmanaged code:  \n  \n-   An access violation that occurs in unsafe managed code can be expressed as either a <xref:System.NullReferenceException> exception or an <xref:System.AccessViolationException> exception, depending on the platform.  \n  \n-   An access violation in unmanaged code that bubbles up to managed code is always wrapped in an <xref:System.AccessViolationException> exception.  \n  \n In either case, you can identify and correct the cause of the <xref:System.AccessViolationException> exception as follows:  \n  \n Make sure that the memory that you are attempting to access has been allocated.  \n An <xref:System.AccessViolationException> exception is always thrown by an attempt to access protected memory -- that is, to access memory that is not allocated or that is not owned by a process.  \n  \n Automatic memory management is one of the services that the common language runtime provides. If managed code provides the same functionality as your unmanagede code, you may wish to move to managed code to take advantage of this functionality. For more information, see [Automatic Memory Management](~/docs/standard/automatic-memory-management.md).  \n  \n Make sure that the memory that you are attempting to access has not been corrupted.  \n If several read or write operations have occurred through bad pointers, memory may be corrupted. This typically occurs when reading or writing to addresses outside of a predefined buffer.  \n  \n## AccessViolationException and try/catch blocks  \n Starting with the [!INCLUDE[net_v40_long](~/includes/net-v40-long-md.md)], <xref:System.AccessViolationException> exceptions thrown by the common language runtime are not handled by the `catch` statement in a structured exception handler if the exception occurs outside of the memory reserved by the common language runtime. To handle such an <xref:System.AccessViolationException> exception, you should apply the  <xref:System.Runtime.ExceptionServices.HandleProcessCorruptedStateExceptionsAttribute> attribute to the method in which the exception is thrown. This change does not affect <xref:System.AccessViolationException> exceptions thrown by user code, which can continue to be caught by a `catch` statement. For code written for previous versions of the .NET Framework that you want to recompile and run without modification on the [!INCLUDE[net_v40_long](~/includes/net-v40-long-md.md)], you can add the [\\<legacyCorruptedStateExceptionsPolicy>](~/docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/legacycorruptedstateexceptionspolicy-element.md) element to your app's configuration file. Note that you can also receive notification of the exceptions if you have defined a handler for the <xref:System.AppDomain.FirstChanceException?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.AppDomain.UnhandledException?displayProperty=fullName> event.  \n  \n## Version Information  \n This exception is thrown in the .NET Framework 2.0 and later versions. In earlier versions of the .NET Framework, an access violation in unmanaged code or unsafe managed code is represented by a <xref:System.NullReferenceException> in managed code. A <xref:System.NullReferenceException> is also thrown when a null reference is dereferenced in verifiable managed code, an occurrence that does not involve data corruption, and there is no way to distinguish between the two situations in versions 1.0 or 1.1.  \n  \n Administrators can allow selected applications to revert to the behavior of the .NET Framework version 1.1.

This usually occurs because a pointer has a bad value. Not all reads or writes through bad pointers lead to access violations, so an access violation usually indicates that several reads or writes have occurred through bad pointers, and that memory might be corrupted. Thus, access violations almost always indicate serious programming errors. An <xref:System.AccessViolationException> clearly identifies these serious errors.  \\n  \\n In programs consisting entirely of verifiable managed code, all references are either valid or null, and access violations are impossible. Any operation that attempts to reference a null reference in verifiable code throws a <xref:System.NullReferenceException> exception. An <xref:System.AccessViolationException> occurs only when verifiable managed code interacts with unmanaged code or with unsafe managed code.  \\n  \\n## Troubleshooting AccessViolationException exceptions  \\n An <xref:System.AccessViolationException> exception can occur only in unsafe managed code or when verifiable managed code interacts with unmanaged code:  \\n  \\n-   An access violation that occurs in unsafe managed code can be expressed as either a <xref:System.NullReferenceException> exception or an <xref:System.AccessViolationException> exception, depending on the platform.  \\n  \\n-   An access violation in unmanaged code that bubbles up to managed code is always wrapped in an <xref:System.AccessViolationException> exception.  \\n  \\n In either case, you can identify and correct the cause of the <xref:System.AccessViolationException> exception as follows:  \\n  \\n Make sure that the memory that you are attempting to access has been allocated.  \\n An <xref:System.AccessViolationException> exception is always thrown by an attempt to access protected memory -- that is, to access memory that is not allocated or that is not owned by a process.  \\n  \\n Automatic memory management is one of the services that the common language runtime provides. If managed code provides the same functionality as your unmanagede code, you may wish to move to managed code to take advantage of this functionality. For more information, see [Automatic Memory Management](~/docs/standard/automatic-memory-management.md).  \\n  \\n Make sure that the memory that you are attempting to access has not been corrupted.  \\n If several read or write operations have occurred through bad pointers, memory may be corrupted. This typically occurs when reading or writing to addresses outside of a predefined buffer.  \\n  \\n## AccessViolationException and try/catch blocks  \\n Starting with the [!INCLUDE[net_v40_long](~/includes/net-v40-long-md.md)], <xref:System.AccessViolationException> exceptions thrown by the common language runtime are not handled by the `catch` statement in a structured exception handler if the exception occurs outside of the memory reserved by the common language runtime. To handle such an <xref:System.AccessViolationException> exception, you should apply the  <xref:System.Runtime.ExceptionServices.HandleProcessCorruptedStateExceptionsAttribute> attribute to the method in which the exception is thrown. This change does not affect <xref:System.AccessViolationException> exceptions thrown by user code, which can continue to be caught by a `catch` statement. For code written for previous versions of the .NET Framework that you want to recompile and run without modification on the [!INCLUDE[net_v40_long](~/includes/net-v40-long-md.md)], you can add the [\\\\<legacyCorruptedStateExceptionsPolicy>](~/docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/legacycorruptedstateexceptionspolicy-element.md) element to your app's configuration file. Note that you can also receive notification of the exceptions if you have defined a handler for the <xref:System.AppDomain.FirstChanceException?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.AppDomain.UnhandledException?displayProperty=fullName> event.  \\n  \\n## Version Information  \\n This exception is thrown in the .NET Framework 2.0 and later versions. In earlier versions of the .NET Framework, an access violation in unmanaged code or unsafe managed code is represented by a <xref:System.NullReferenceException> in managed code. A <xref:System.NullReferenceException> is also thrown when a null reference is dereferenced in verifiable managed code, an occurrence that does not involve data corruption, and there is no way to distinguish between the two situations in versions 1.0 or 1.1.  \\n  \\n Administrators can allow selected applications to revert to the behavior of the .NET Framework version 1.1.
