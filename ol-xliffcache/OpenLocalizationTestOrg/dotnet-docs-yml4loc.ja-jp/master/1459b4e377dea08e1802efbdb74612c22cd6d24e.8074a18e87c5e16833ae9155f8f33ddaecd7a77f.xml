Therefore, using `foreach` is recommended instead of directly manipulating the enumerator.  \\n  \\n Enumerators can be used to read the data in the collection, but they cannot be used to modify the underlying collection.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Reset%2A> method is provided for COM interoperability and does not need to be fully implemented; instead, the implementer can throw a <xref:System.NotSupportedException>.  \\n  \\n Initially, the enumerator is positioned before the first element in the collection. You must call the <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> method to advance the enumerator to the first element of the collection before reading the value of <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Current%2A>; otherwise, <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Current%2A> is undefined.  \\n  \\n <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Current%2A> returns the same object until either <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> or <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Reset%2A> is called. <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> sets <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Current%2A> to the next element.  \\n  \\n If <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> passes the end of the collection, the enumerator is positioned after the last element in the collection and <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> returns `false`. When the enumerator is at this position, subsequent calls to <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> also return `false`. If the last call to <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> returned `false`, calling <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Current%2A> throws an exception.  \\n  \\n To set <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Current%2A> to the first element of the collection again, you can call <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Reset%2A>, if it’s implemented, followed by <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A>. If <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Reset%2A> is not implemented, you must create a new enumerator instance to return to the first element of the collection.  \\n  \\n An enumerator remains valid as long as the collection remains unchanged. If changes are made to the collection, such as adding, modifying, or deleting elements, the enumerator is irrecoverably invalidated and the next call to <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> or <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Reset%2A> throws an <xref:System.InvalidOperationException>. If the collection is modified between <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> and <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Current%2A>, <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Current%2A> returns the element that it is set to, even if the enumerator is already invalidated.  \\n  \\n The enumerator does not have exclusive access to the collection; therefore, enumerating through a collection is intrinsically not a thread-safe procedure. Even when a collection is synchronized, other threads can still modify the collection, which causes the enumerator to throw an exception. To guarantee thread safety during enumeration, you can either lock the collection during the entire enumeration or catch the exceptions resulting from changes made by other threads.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example demonstrates the implementation of the <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerable> and <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator> interfaces for a custom collection.
