Using <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog>, you can read from existing logs, write entries to logs, create or delete event sources, delete logs, and respond to log entries. You can also create new logs when creating an event source.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  This type implements the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface. When you have finished using the type, you should dispose of it either directly or indirectly. To dispose of the type directly, call its <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method in a `try`/`catch` block. To dispose of it indirectly, use a language construct such as `using` (in C#) or `Using` (in Visual Basic). For more information, see the \"Using an Object that Implements IDisposable\" section in the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface topic.  \n  \n In addition to providing access to individual event logs and their entries, the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog> class lets you access the collection of all event logs. You can use the `static` members of <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog> to delete logs, get log lists, create or delete a source, or determine if a computer already contains a particular source.  \n  \n There are three default event logs: Application, System, and Security. A Security log is read-only. Other applications and services you install, such as Active Directory, might have additional event logs.  \n  \n There are security considerations when using the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog> class. <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog> requires <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogPermission> permissions for specific actions in the .NET Framework 2.0 and later versions, or full trust in the .NET Framework 1.0 and 1.1. We recommend that <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogPermission> not be granted to partially trusted code.  You should never pass any event log object, including <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogEntryCollection> and <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogEntry> objects, to less trusted code. For example, creating an <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog> object, writing an entry, and then passing the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog> object to partially trusted code can create a security issue, because the ability to read and write to the event log allows code to perform actions such as issuing event log messages in the name of another application.  \n  \n Starting with Windows Vista, User Account Control (UAC) determines the credentials of a user. If you are a member of the Built-in Administrators group, you are assigned two run-time access tokens: a standard user access token and an administrator access token. By default, you are in the standard user role. To run the code that accesses the Security log, you must first elevate your credentials from standard user to administrator. You can do this when you start an application by opening the shortcut menu for the application (if you're using a mouse, right-click the application icon) and indicating that you want to run as an administrator.  \n  \n You can use <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog> to create custom event logs that you can view through the server's Event Viewer. Use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.RegisterDisplayName%2A> method to display a localized name for your event log in the Event Viewer. Use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.ModifyOverflowPolicy%2A> method to configure the behavior of your event log when it reaches its maximum log size.  \n  \n To read from an event log, specify the log name (<xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Log%2A> property) and server computer name (<xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.MachineName%2A> property for the event log. If you don't specify the server computer name, the local computer, \".\", is assumed. It's not necessary to specify the event source (<xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Source%2A> property), because a source is required only for writing to logs. The  <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Entries%2A> property is automatically populated with the event log's list of entries.  \n  \n To write to an event log, specify or create an event source (<xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Source%2A> property). You must have administrative credentials on the computer to create a new event source. The event source registers your application with the event log as a valid source of entries. You can use the event source  to write to only one log at a time. The <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Source%2A> property can be any random string, but the name must be distinct from other sources on the computer. The event source is typically the name of the application or another identifying string. Trying to create a duplicate <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Source%2A> value throws an exception. However, a single event log can be associated with multiple sources.  \n  \n If the event source for the event log associated with the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog> instance doesn't exist, a new event source is created. To create an event source in Windows Vista and later or Windows Server 2003, you must have administrative credentials.  \n  \n This requirement is because all event logs, including Security logs, must be searched to determine whether the event source is unique. Starting with Windows Vista, users do not have permission to access the Security log; therefore, a <xref:System.Security.SecurityException> is thrown.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  Creating or deleting an event source requires synchronization of the underlying code by using a named mutex. If a highly privileged application locks the named mutex, trying to create or delete an event source causes the application to stop responding until the lock is released. To help prevent this problem, never grant <xref:System.Security.Permissions.SecurityPermissionFlag.UnmanagedCode> permission to untrusted code. In addition, <xref:System.Security.Permissions.SecurityPermissionFlag.UnmanagedCode> permission potentially allows other permissions to be bypassed and should only be granted to highly trusted code.  \n  \n Applications and services should write to the Application log or to a custom log. Device drivers should write to the System log. If you do not explicitly set the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Log%2A> property, the event log defaults to the Application log.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  There is nothing to protect an application from writing as any registered source.  If an application is granted <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogPermissionAccess.Write> permission, it can write events for any valid source registered on the computer.  \n  \n Use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEvent%2A> and <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEntry%2A> methods to write events to an event log. You must specify an event source to write events; you must create and configure the event source before writing the first entry with the source.  \n  \n Create the new event source during the installation of your application. This allows time for the operating system to refresh its list of registered event sources and their configuration. If the operating system hasn't refreshed its list of event sources, and you try to write an event with the new source, the write operation will fail. You can configure a new source by using an <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogInstaller> object or the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.CreateEventSource%2A> method. You must have administrative credentials on the computer to create a new event source.  \n  \n Each source can write to only one event log at a time; however, your application can use multiple sources to write to multiple event logs. For example, your application might require multiple sources configured for different event logs or different resource files. To change the configuration details of an existing source, you must delete the source and then create it with the new configuration. If other applications or components use the existing source, create a new source with the updated configuration instead of deleting the existing source.  \n  \n You can register the event source with localized resources for your event category and message strings. Your application can write event log entries by using resource identifiers instead of specifying the actual string values. Refer to the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogInstaller> and <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventSourceCreationData> classes for more information about configuring your source with resource files.  \n  \n If your application writes string values directly to the event log, you do not have to set the resource file properties for the source. The source must be configured either for writing localized entries or for writing direct strings. If your application writes entries using both resource identifiers and string values, you must register two separate sources. For example, configure one source with resource files, and then use that source in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEvent%2A> method to write entries using resource identifiers to the event log. Then create a different source without resource files, and use that source in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEntry%2A> method to write strings directly to the event log using that source.  \n  \n When writing events, you must at least specify either a message string or the resource identifier for a message string. Other event properties are optional. Examples of optional event settings include the following:  \n  \n-   You can set the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogEntryType> to specify the icon that the Event Viewer displays for the entry.  \n  \n-   You can specify a category identifier for the event, if your application uses categories for filtering the events.  \n  \n-   You can attach binary data to your event entry if you want to associate additional information with a given event.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  Event logging consumes disk space, processor time, and other system resources. It is important to log only essential information. We recommend that you place event log calls in an error path, rather than in the main code path, so they don't adversely affect performance.  \n  \n For a list of initial property values for an instance of <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog>, see the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.%23ctor%2A> constructor.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,384],"content":"<xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog> lets you access or customize Windows event logs, which record information about important software or hardware events.

Starting with Windows Vista, users do not have permission to access the security log; therefore, a <xref:System.Security.SecurityException> is thrown.  \n>   \n>  Starting with Windows Vista, User Account Control (UAC) determines the privileges of a user. If you are a member of the Built-in Administrators group, you are assigned two run-time access tokens: a standard user access token and an administrator access token. By default, you are in the standard user role. To execute the code that accesses the security log, you must first elevate your privileges from standard user to administrator. You can do this when you start an application by right-clicking the application icon and indicating that you want to run as an administrator.  \n  \n Use <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEvent%2A> and <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEntry%2A> to write events to an event log. You must specify an event source to write events; you must create and configure the event source before writing the first entry with the source.  \n  \n Create the new event source during the installation of your application. This allows time for the operating system to refresh its list of registered event sources and their configuration. If the operating system has not refreshed its list of event sources, and you attempt to write an event with the new source, the write operation will fail. You can configure a new source using an <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogInstaller>, or using the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.CreateEventSource%2A> method. You must have administrative rights on the computer to create a new event source.  \n  \n You can create an event source for an existing event log or a new event log. When you create a new source for a new event log, the system registers the source for that log, but the log is not created until the first entry is written to it.  \n  \n The operating system stores event logs as files. When you use <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogInstaller> or <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.CreateEventSource%2A> to create a new event log, the associated file is stored in the %SystemRoot%\\System32\\Config directory on the specified computer. The file name is set by appending the first 8 characters of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Log%2A> property with the \".evt\" file name extension.  \n  \n Each source can only write to only one event log at a time; however, your application can use multiple sources to write to multiple event logs. For example, your application might require multiple sources configured for different event logs or different resource files.  \n  \n You can register the event source with localized resource file(s) for your event category and message strings. Your application can write event log entries using resource identifiers, rather than specifying the actual string. The Event Viewer uses the resource identifier to find and display the corresponding string from the localized resource file based on current language settings. You can register a separate file for event categories, messages and parameter insertion strings, or you can register the same resource file for all three types of strings. Use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventSourceCreationData.CategoryCount%2A>, <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventSourceCreationData.CategoryResourceFile%2A>, <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventSourceCreationData.MessageResourceFile%2A>, and <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventSourceCreationData.ParameterResourceFile%2A> properties to configure the source to write localized entries to the event log. If your application writes strings values directly to the event log, you do not need to set these properties.  \n  \n The source must be configured either for writing localized entries or for writing direct strings. If your application writes entries using both resource identifiers and string values, you must register two separate sources. For example, configure one source with resource files, and then use that source in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEvent%2A> method to write entries using resource identifiers to the event log. Then create a different source without resource files, and use that source in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEntry%2A> method to write strings directly to the event log using that source.  \n  \n To change the configuration details of an existing source, you must delete the source and then create it with the new configuration. If other applications or components use the existing source, create a new source with the updated configuration rather than deleting the existing source.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  If a source is configured for an event log, and you reconfigure it for another event log, you must restart the computer for the changes to take effect.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,189],"content":"Use this overload to configure a new source for writing entries to an event log on the local computer or a remote computer.

If the operating system has not refreshed its list of event sources, and you attempt to write an event with the new source, the write operation will fail. You can configure a new source using an <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogInstaller>, or using the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.CreateEventSource%2A> method. You must have administrative rights on the computer to create a new event source.  \n  \n You can create an event source for an existing event log or a new event log. When you create a new source for a new event log, the system registers the source for that log, but the log is not created until the first entry is written to it.  \n  \n The operating system stores event logs as files.

Each source can write to only one event log at a time; however, your application can use multiple sources to write to multiple event logs. For example, your application might require multiple sources configured for different event logs or different resource files.  \n  \n The source must be configured either for writing localized entries or for writing direct strings. If your application writes entries using both resource identifiers and string values, you must register two separate sources. For example, configure one source with resource files, and then use that source in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEvent%2A> method to write entries using resource identifiers to the event log.

Before writing an entry to an event log, you must register the event source with the event log as a valid source of events. When you write a log entry, the system uses the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Source%2A> property to find the appropriate log in which to place your entry. If you are reading the event log, you can either specify the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Source%2A>, or a <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Log%2A> and <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.MachineName%2A>.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  You are not required to specify the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.MachineName%2A> if you are connecting to a log on the local computer.

This allows time for the operating system to refresh its list of registered event sources and their configuration. If the operating system has not refreshed its list of event sources, and you attempt to write an event with the new source, the write operation will fail. You can configure a new source using an <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogInstaller>, or using the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.CreateEventSource%2A> method. You must have administrative rights on the computer to create a new event source.  \n  \n You can create an event source for an existing event log or a new event log. When you create a new source for a new event log, the system registers the source for that log, but the log is not created until the first entry is written to it.  \n  \n The source must be unique on the local computer; a new source name cannot match an existing source name or an existing event log name.

If your application writes entries using both resource identifiers and string values, you must register two separate sources. For example, configure one source with resource files, and then use that source in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEvent%2A> method to write entries using resource identifiers to the event log. Then create a different source without resource files, and use that source in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEntry%2A> method to write strings directly to the event log using that source.  \n  \n To change the configuration details of an existing source, you must delete the source and then create it with the new configuration.

The Event Viewer does not interpret this data; it displays raw data only in a combined hexadecimal and text format. Use event-specific data sparingly; include it only if you are sure it will be useful. You can also use event-specific data to store information the application can process independently of the Event Viewer. For example, you could write a viewer specifically for your events, or write a program that scans the logfile and creates reports that include information from the event-specific data.  \n  \n In addition to the binary data, you can specify an application-defined category and an application-defined event identifier. The Event Viewer uses the category to filter events written by an event source. The Event Viewer can display the category as a numeric value, or it can use the category as a resource identifier to display a localized category string.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The `category` parameter should be a positive value. Negative category values appear as a complementary positive number in the Event Viewer. For example, a –10 will appear as 65,526, a –1 as 65,535.  \n  \n To display localized category strings in the Event Viewer, you must use an event source configured with a category resource file, and set the `category` to a resource identifier in the category resource file. If the event source does not have a configured category resource file, or the specified `category` does not index a string in the category resource file, then the Event Viewer displays the numeric category value for that entry. Configure the category resource file, along with the number of category strings in the resource file, using the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogInstaller> or the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventSourceCreationData> class.  \n  \n Event identifiers, together with the event source, uniquely identify an event. Each application can define its own numbered events and the description strings to which they map. Event viewers display these string values to help the user understand what went wrong and suggest what actions to take.  \n  \n Finally, you can specify an <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogEntryType> for the event being written to the event log. The `type` is indicated by an icon and text in the Type column in the Event Viewer for a log. This parameter indicates whether the event type is error, warning, information, success audit, or failure audit.  \n  \n You must create and configure the event source before writing the first entry with the source. Create the new event source during the installation of your application. This allows time for the operating system to refresh its list of registered event sources and their configuration. If the operating system has not refreshed its list of event sources, and you attempt to write an event with the new source, the write operation will fail. You can configure a new source using an <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogInstaller>, or using the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.CreateEventSource%2A> method. You must have administrative rights on the computer to create a new event source.  \n  \n The source must be configured either for writing localized entries or for writing direct strings. The <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEntry%2A> method writes the given string directly to the event log; it does not use a localizable message resource file. Use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEvent%2A> method to write events using a localized message resource file.  \n  \n If your application writes entries using both resource identifiers and string values, you must register two separate sources. For example, configure one source with resource files, and then use that source in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEvent%2A> method to write entries using resource identifiers to the event log. Then create a different source without resource files, and use that source in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEntry%2A> method to write strings directly to the event log using that source.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  If the `message` parameter contains a NUL character, the message in the event log is terminated at the NUL character.  \n>   \n>  The `message` string cannot contain %*n*, where *n* is an integer value (for example, %1), because the event viewer treats it as an insertion string.

Negative category values appear as a complementary positive number in the Event Viewer. For example, a –10 appears as 65,526, a –1 as 65,535.  \n  \n To display localized category strings in the Event Viewer, you must use an event source configured with a category resource file, and set the `category` to a resource identifier in the category resource file. If the event source does not have a configured category resource file, or the specified `category` does not index a string in the category resource file, then the Event Viewer displays the numeric category value for that entry. Configure the category resource file, along with the number of category strings in the resource file, using the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogInstaller> or the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventSourceCreationData> class.  \n  \n In addition to the category, you can specify an event identifier for the event being written to the event log. Event identifiers, along with the event source, uniquely identify an event. Each application can define its own numbered events and the description strings to which they map. Event viewers display these string values to help the user understand what went wrong and suggest what actions to take.  \n  \n Finally, you can specify an <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogEntryType> for the event being written to the event log. The `type` is indicated by an icon and text in the Type column in the Event Viewer for a log. This parameter indicates whether the event type is error, warning, information, success audit, or failure audit.  \n  \n You must create and configure the event source before writing the first entry with the source. Create the new event source during the installation of your application. This allows time for the operating system to refresh its list of registered event sources and their configuration. If the operating system has not refreshed its list of event sources, and you attempt to write an event with the new source, the write operation will fail. You can configure a new source using an <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogInstaller>, or using the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.CreateEventSource%2A> method. You must have administrative rights on the computer to create a new event source.  \n  \n The source must be configured either for writing localized entries or for writing direct strings.

Use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEvent%2A> method to write events using a localized message resource file.  \n  \n If your application writes entries using both resource identifiers and string values, you must register two separate sources. For example, configure one source with resource files, and then use that source in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEvent%2A> method to write entries using resource identifiers to the event log. Then create a different source without resource files, and use that source in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEntry%2A> method to write strings directly to the event log using that source.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  If the `message` parameter contains a NUL character, the message in the event log is terminated at the NUL character.  \n>   \n>  The `message` string cannot contain %*n*, where *n* is an integer value (for example, %1), because the event viewer treats it as an insertion string.

The Event Viewer does not interpret this data; it displays raw data only in a combined hexadecimal and text format. Use event-specific data sparingly, including it only if you are sure it will be useful to someone debugging the problem. You can also use event-specific data to store information the application can process independently of the Event Viewer. For example, you could write a viewer specifically for your events, or write a program that scans the logfile and creates reports that include information from the event-specific data.  \n  \n In addition to the binary data, you can specify an application-defined category and an application-defined event identifier. The Event Viewer uses the category to filter events written by an event source. The Event Viewer can display the category as a numeric value, or it can use the category as a resource identifier to display a localized category string.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The `message` string cannot contain %*n*, where *n* is an integer value (for example, %1), because the event viewer treats it as an insertion string. Because an Internet Protocol, version 6 (IPv6) address can contain this character sequence, you cannot log an event message that contains an IPv6 address.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The `category` parameter should be a positive value. Negative category values appear as a complementary positive number in the Event Viewer. For example, a –10 appears as 65,526, a –1 as 65,535.  \n  \n To display localized category strings in the Event Viewer, you must use an event source configured with a category resource file, and set the `category` to a resource identifier in the category resource file. If the event source does not have a configured category resource file, or the specified `category` does not index a string in the category resource file, then the Event Viewer displays the numeric category value for that entry. Configure the category resource file, along with the number of category strings in the resource file, using the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogInstaller> or the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventSourceCreationData> class.  \n  \n Event identifiers, along with the event source, uniquely identify an event. Each application can define its own numbered events and the description strings to which they map. Event viewers display these string values to help the user understand what went wrong and suggest what actions to take.  \n  \n Finally, you can specify an <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogEntryType> for the event being written to the event log. The `type` is indicated by an icon and text in the Type column in the Event Viewer for a log. This parameter indicates whether the event type is error, warning, information, success audit, or failure audit.  \n  \n You must set the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Source%2A> property on your <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog> component before you can write entries to the log. You must create and configure the event source before writing the first entry with the source.  \n  \n Create the new event source during the installation of your application. This allows time for the operating system to refresh its list of registered event sources and their configuration. If the operating system has not refreshed its list of event sources, and you attempt to write an event with the new source, the write operation will fail. You can configure a new source using an <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogInstaller>, or using the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.CreateEventSource%2A> method. You must have administrative rights on the computer to create a new event source.  \n  \n If the source specified in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Source%2A> property of this <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog> instance is not registered on the computer that your component is writing to, <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEntry%2A> calls <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.CreateEventSource%2A> and registers the source.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  If you do not specify a <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.MachineName%2A> for your <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog> instance before you call <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.CreateEventSource%2A> or <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEntry%2A>, the local computer (\".\") is assumed.  \n  \n If the system needs to register the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Source%2A> through a call to <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEntry%2A> and the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Log%2A> property has not been set on your <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog> instance, the log defaults to the Application log.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Many exceptions listed above are generated by errors raised during the process of registering the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Source%2A>.  \n  \n The source must be configured either for writing localized entries or for writing direct strings. The <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEntry%2A> method writes the given string directly to the event log; it does not use a localizable message resource file. Use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEvent%2A> method to write events using a localized message resource file.  \n  \n If your application writes entries using both resource identifiers and string values, you must register two separate sources. For example, configure one source with resource files, and then use that source in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEvent%2A> method to write entries using resource identifiers to the event log. Then create a different source without resource files, and use that source in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEntry%2A> method to write strings directly to the event log using that source.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  If you write an entry to a remote computer, the value of the message (the text string) might not be what you expect if the remote computer is not running the .NET Framework.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  If the `message` parameter contains a NUL character, the message in the event log is terminated at the NUL character.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,627],"content":"Use this overload to write application-defined event-specific data to the event log.

Because an Internet Protocol, version 6 (IPv6) address can contain this character sequence, you cannot log an event message that contains an IPv6 address.  \n  \n To display localized category strings in the Event Viewer, you must use an event source configured with a category resource file, and set the `category` to a resource identifier in the category resource file. If the event source does not have a configured category resource file, or the specified `category` does not index a string in the category resource file, then the Event Viewer displays the numeric category value for that entry. Configure the category resource file, along with the number of category strings in the resource file, using the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogInstaller> or the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventSourceCreationData> class.  \n  \n In addition to the category, you can specify an event identifier for the event being written to the event log. Event identifiers, along with the event source, uniquely identify an event. Each application can define its own numbered events and the description strings to which they map. Event viewers display these string values to help the user understand what went wrong and suggest what actions to take.  \n  \n Finally, you can specify an <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogEntryType> for the event being written to the event log. The `type` is indicated by an icon and text in the Type column in the Event Viewer for a log. This parameter indicates whether the event type is error, warning, information, success audit, or failure audit.  \n  \n You must set the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Source%2A> property on your <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog> component before you can write entries to the log. You must create and configure the event source before writing the first entry with the source.  \n  \n Create the new event source during the installation of your application. This allows time for the operating system to refresh its list of registered event sources and their configuration. If the operating system has not refreshed its list of event sources, and you attempt to write an event with the new source, the write operation will fail. You can configure a new source using an <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogInstaller>, or using the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.CreateEventSource%2A> method.

Using <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog>, you can read from existing logs, write entries to logs, create or delete event sources, delete logs, and respond to log entries. You can also create new logs when creating an event source.  \\n  \\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\n>  This type implements the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface. When you have finished using the type, you should dispose of it either directly or indirectly. To dispose of the type directly, call its <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method in a `try`/`catch` block. To dispose of it indirectly, use a language construct such as `using` (in C#) or `Using` (in Visual Basic). For more information, see the \\\"Using an Object that Implements IDisposable\\\" section in the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface topic.  \\n  \\n In addition to providing access to individual event logs and their entries, the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog> class lets you access the collection of all event logs. You can use the `static` members of <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog> to delete logs, get log lists, create or delete a source, or determine if a computer already contains a particular source.  \\n  \\n There are three default event logs: Application, System, and Security. A Security log is read-only. Other applications and services you install, such as Active Directory, might have additional event logs.  \\n  \\n There are security considerations when using the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog> class. <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog> requires <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogPermission> permissions for specific actions in the .NET Framework 2.0 and later versions, or full trust in the .NET Framework 1.0 and 1.1. We recommend that <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogPermission> not be granted to partially trusted code.  You should never pass any event log object, including <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogEntryCollection> and <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogEntry> objects, to less trusted code. For example, creating an <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog> object, writing an entry, and then passing the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog> object to partially trusted code can create a security issue, because the ability to read and write to the event log allows code to perform actions such as issuing event log messages in the name of another application.  \\n  \\n Starting with Windows Vista, User Account Control (UAC) determines the credentials of a user. If you are a member of the Built-in Administrators group, you are assigned two run-time access tokens: a standard user access token and an administrator access token. By default, you are in the standard user role. To run the code that accesses the Security log, you must first elevate your credentials from standard user to administrator. You can do this when you start an application by opening the shortcut menu for the application (if you're using a mouse, right-click the application icon) and indicating that you want to run as an administrator.  \\n  \\n You can use <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog> to create custom event logs that you can view through the server's Event Viewer. Use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.RegisterDisplayName%2A> method to display a localized name for your event log in the Event Viewer. Use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.ModifyOverflowPolicy%2A> method to configure the behavior of your event log when it reaches its maximum log size.  \\n  \\n To read from an event log, specify the log name (<xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Log%2A> property) and server computer name (<xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.MachineName%2A> property for the event log. If you don't specify the server computer name, the local computer, \\\".\\\", is assumed. It's not necessary to specify the event source (<xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Source%2A> property), because a source is required only for writing to logs. The  <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Entries%2A> property is automatically populated with the event log's list of entries.  \\n  \\n To write to an event log, specify or create an event source (<xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Source%2A> property). You must have administrative credentials on the computer to create a new event source. The event source registers your application with the event log as a valid source of entries. You can use the event source  to write to only one log at a time. The <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Source%2A> property can be any random string, but the name must be distinct from other sources on the computer. The event source is typically the name of the application or another identifying string. Trying to create a duplicate <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Source%2A> value throws an exception. However, a single event log can be associated with multiple sources.  \\n  \\n If the event source for the event log associated with the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog> instance doesn't exist, a new event source is created. To create an event source in Windows Vista and later or Windows Server 2003, you must have administrative credentials.  \\n  \\n This requirement is because all event logs, including Security logs, must be searched to determine whether the event source is unique. Starting with Windows Vista, users do not have permission to access the Security log; therefore, a <xref:System.Security.SecurityException> is thrown.  \\n  \\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\n>  Creating or deleting an event source requires synchronization of the underlying code by using a named mutex. If a highly privileged application locks the named mutex, trying to create or delete an event source causes the application to stop responding until the lock is released. To help prevent this problem, never grant <xref:System.Security.Permissions.SecurityPermissionFlag.UnmanagedCode> permission to untrusted code. In addition, <xref:System.Security.Permissions.SecurityPermissionFlag.UnmanagedCode> permission potentially allows other permissions to be bypassed and should only be granted to highly trusted code.  \\n  \\n Applications and services should write to the Application log or to a custom log. Device drivers should write to the System log. If you do not explicitly set the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Log%2A> property, the event log defaults to the Application log.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  There is nothing to protect an application from writing as any registered source.  If an application is granted <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogPermissionAccess.Write> permission, it can write events for any valid source registered on the computer.  \\n  \\n Use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEvent%2A> and <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEntry%2A> methods to write events to an event log. You must specify an event source to write events; you must create and configure the event source before writing the first entry with the source.  \\n  \\n Create the new event source during the installation of your application. This allows time for the operating system to refresh its list of registered event sources and their configuration. If the operating system hasn't refreshed its list of event sources, and you try to write an event with the new source, the write operation will fail. You can configure a new source by using an <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogInstaller> object or the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.CreateEventSource%2A> method. You must have administrative credentials on the computer to create a new event source.  \\n  \\n Each source can write to only one event log at a time; however, your application can use multiple sources to write to multiple event logs. For example, your application might require multiple sources configured for different event logs or different resource files. To change the configuration details of an existing source, you must delete the source and then create it with the new configuration. If other applications or components use the existing source, create a new source with the updated configuration instead of deleting the existing source.  \\n  \\n You can register the event source with localized resources for your event category and message strings. Your application can write event log entries by using resource identifiers instead of specifying the actual string values. Refer to the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogInstaller> and <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventSourceCreationData> classes for more information about configuring your source with resource files.  \\n  \\n If your application writes string values directly to the event log, you do not have to set the resource file properties for the source. The source must be configured either for writing localized entries or for writing direct strings. If your application writes entries using both resource identifiers and string values, you must register two separate sources. For example, configure one source with resource files, and then use that source in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEvent%2A> method to write entries using resource identifiers to the event log. Then create a different source without resource files, and use that source in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEntry%2A> method to write strings directly to the event log using that source.  \\n  \\n When writing events, you must at least specify either a message string or the resource identifier for a message string. Other event properties are optional. Examples of optional event settings include the following:  \\n  \\n-   You can set the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogEntryType> to specify the icon that the Event Viewer displays for the entry.  \\n  \\n-   You can specify a category identifier for the event, if your application uses categories for filtering the events.  \\n  \\n-   You can attach binary data to your event entry if you want to associate additional information with a given event.  \\n  \\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\n>  Event logging consumes disk space, processor time, and other system resources. It is important to log only essential information. We recommend that you place event log calls in an error path, rather than in the main code path, so they don't adversely affect performance.  \\n  \\n For a list of initial property values for an instance of <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog>, see the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.%23ctor%2A> constructor.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following example creates the event source `MySource` if it doesn't already exist, and writes an entry to the event log `MyNewLog`.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  Starting with Windows Vista, you must run this application as an administrator.  \\n  \\n [!code-cpp[Classic EventLog.CreateEventSource Example#1](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR_Classic/classic EventLog.CreateEventSource Example/CPP/source.cpp#1)]\\n [!code-csharp[Classic EventLog.CreateEventSource Example#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_Classic/classic EventLog.CreateEventSource Example/CS/source.cs#1)]\\n [!code-vb[Classic EventLog.CreateEventSource Example#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_Classic/classic EventLog.CreateEventSource Example/VB/source.vb#1)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: 'public class EventLog : System.ComponentModel.Component, System.ComponentModel.ISupportInitialize'\n  inheritance:\n  - System.Object\n  - System.MarshalByRefObject\n  - System.ComponentModel.Component\n  implements:\n  - System.ComponentModel.ISupportInitialize\n  inheritedMembers:\n  - System.ComponentModel.Component.CanRaiseEvents\n  - System.ComponentModel.Component.Container\n  - System.ComponentModel.Component.DesignMode\n  - System.ComponentModel.Component.Dispose\n  - System.ComponentModel.Component.Disposed\n  - System.ComponentModel.Component.Events\n  - System.ComponentModel.Component.GetService(System.Type)\n  - System.ComponentModel.Component.Site\n  - System.ComponentModel.Component.ToString\n  - System.MarshalByRefObject.CreateObjRef(System.Type)\n  - System.MarshalByRefObject.GetLifetimeService\n  - System.MarshalByRefObject.InitializeLifetimeService\n  - System.MarshalByRefObject.MemberwiseClone(System.Boolean)\n  - System.Object.Equals(System.Object)\n  - System.Object.Equals(System.Object,System.Object)\n  - System.Object.GetHashCode\n  - System.Object.GetType\n  - System.Object.MemberwiseClone\n  - System.Object.ReferenceEquals(System.Object,System.Object)\n  attributes: []\n  version:\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  - xamarinmac-3.0\n  monikers:\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  - xamarinmac-3.0\n  content_git_url: https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/xml/System.Diagnostics/EventLog.xml\n  ms.technology:\n  - dotnet-standard\n  author: mairaw\n  ms.author: mairaw\n  manager: wpickett\n- uid: System.Diagnostics.EventLog.#ctor\n  commentId: M:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.#ctor\n  id: '#ctor'\n  parent: System.Diagnostics.EventLog\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: EventLog()\n  nameWithType: EventLog.EventLog()\n  fullName: EventLog.EventLog()\n  type: Constructor\n  assemblies:\n  - System\n  namespace: System.Diagnostics\n  summary: Initializes a new instance of the <xref href=\"System.Diagnostics.EventLog\"></xref> class.

It is not necessary to use this method to read from an event log.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.CreateEventSource%2A> method uses the input `sourceData`<xref:System.Diagnostics.EventSourceCreationData.Source%2A>, <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventSourceCreationData.LogName%2A> and <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventSourceCreationData.MachineName%2A> properties to create registry values on the target computer for the new source and its associated event log. A new source name cannot match an existing source name or an existing event log name on the target computer. If the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventSourceCreationData.LogName%2A> property is not set, the source is registered for the Application event log. If the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventSourceCreationData.MachineName%2A> is not set, the source is registered on the local computer.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  To create an event source in Windows Vista and later or Windows Server 2003, you must have administrative privileges.  \\n>   \\n>  The reason for this requirement is that all event logs, including security, must be searched to determine whether the event source is unique. Starting with Windows Vista, users do not have permission to access the security log; therefore, a <xref:System.Security.SecurityException> is thrown.  \\n>   \\n>  Starting with Windows Vista, User Account Control (UAC) determines the privileges of a user. If you are a member of the Built-in Administrators group, you are assigned two run-time access tokens: a standard user access token and an administrator access token. By default, you are in the standard user role. To execute the code that accesses the security log, you must first elevate your privileges from standard user to administrator. You can do this when you start an application by right-clicking the application icon and indicating that you want to run as an administrator.  \\n  \\n Use <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEvent%2A> and <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEntry%2A> to write events to an event log. You must specify an event source to write events; you must create and configure the event source before writing the first entry with the source.  \\n  \\n Create the new event source during the installation of your application. This allows time for the operating system to refresh its list of registered event sources and their configuration. If the operating system has not refreshed its list of event sources, and you attempt to write an event with the new source, the write operation will fail. You can configure a new source using an <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogInstaller>, or using the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.CreateEventSource%2A> method. You must have administrative rights on the computer to create a new event source.  \\n  \\n You can create an event source for an existing event log or a new event log. When you create a new source for a new event log, the system registers the source for that log, but the log is not created until the first entry is written to it.  \\n  \\n The operating system stores event logs as files. When you use <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogInstaller> or <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.CreateEventSource%2A> to create a new event log, the associated file is stored in the %SystemRoot%\\\\System32\\\\Config directory on the specified computer. The file name is set by appending the first 8 characters of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Log%2A> property with the \\\".evt\\\" file name extension.  \\n  \\n Each source can only write to only one event log at a time; however, your application can use multiple sources to write to multiple event logs. For example, your application might require multiple sources configured for different event logs or different resource files.  \\n  \\n You can register the event source with localized resource file(s) for your event category and message strings. Your application can write event log entries using resource identifiers, rather than specifying the actual string. The Event Viewer uses the resource identifier to find and display the corresponding string from the localized resource file based on current language settings. You can register a separate file for event categories, messages and parameter insertion strings, or you can register the same resource file for all three types of strings. Use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventSourceCreationData.CategoryCount%2A>, <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventSourceCreationData.CategoryResourceFile%2A>, <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventSourceCreationData.MessageResourceFile%2A>, and <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventSourceCreationData.ParameterResourceFile%2A> properties to configure the source to write localized entries to the event log. If your application writes strings values directly to the event log, you do not need to set these properties.  \\n  \\n The source must be configured either for writing localized entries or for writing direct strings. If your application writes entries using both resource identifiers and string values, you must register two separate sources. For example, configure one source with resource files, and then use that source in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEvent%2A> method to write entries using resource identifiers to the event log. Then create a different source without resource files, and use that source in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEntry%2A> method to write strings directly to the event log using that source.  \\n  \\n To change the configuration details of an existing source, you must delete the source and then create it with the new configuration. If other applications or components use the existing source, create a new source with the updated configuration rather than deleting the existing source.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  If a source is configured for an event log, and you reconfigure it for another event log, you must restart the computer for the changes to take effect.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following example determines whether the event source named `SampleApplicationSource` is registered on the local computer.

You can do this when you start an application by right-clicking the application icon and indicating that you want to run as an administrator.  \\n  \\n You only need to create an event source if you are writing to the event log. Before writing an entry to an event log, you must register the event source with the event log as a valid source of events. When you write a log entry, the system uses the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Source%2A> to find the appropriate log in which to place your entry. If you are reading the event log, you can either specify the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Source%2A>, or a <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Log%2A> and <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.MachineName%2A>.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  You are not required to specify the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.MachineName%2A> if you are connecting to a log on the local computer.

You must specify an event source to write events; you must create and configure the event source before writing the first entry with the source.  \\n  \\n Create the new event source during the installation of your application. This allows time for the operating system to refresh its list of registered event sources and their configuration. If the operating system has not refreshed its list of event sources, and you attempt to write an event with the new source, the write operation will fail. You can configure a new source using an <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogInstaller>, or using the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.CreateEventSource%2A> method. You must have administrative rights on the computer to create a new event source.  \\n  \\n You can create an event source for an existing event log or a new event log. When you create a new source for a new event log, the system registers the source for that log, but the log is not created until the first entry is written to it.  \\n  \\n The operating system stores event logs as files. When you use <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogInstaller> or <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.CreateEventSource%2A> to create a new event log, the associated file is stored in the %SystemRoot%\\\\System32\\\\Config directory on the specified computer. The file name is set by appending the first 8 characters of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Log%2A> property with the \\\".evt\\\" file name extension.  \\n  \\n The source must be unique on the local computer; a new source name cannot match an existing source name or an existing event log name. Each source can write to only one event log at a time; however, your application can use multiple sources to write to multiple event logs. For example, your application might require multiple sources configured for different event logs or different resource files.  \\n  \\n The source must be configured either for writing localized entries or for writing direct strings. If your application writes entries using both resource identifiers and string values, you must register two separate sources. For example, configure one source with resource files, and then use that source in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEvent%2A> method to write entries using resource identifiers to the event log. Then create a different source without resource files, and use that source in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEntry%2A> method to write strings directly to the event log using that source.  \\n  \\n To change the configuration details of an existing source, you must delete the source and then create it with the new configuration.

It is often the name of the application, or the name of a subcomponent of the application, if the application is large. Applications and services should write to the Application log or a custom log. Device drivers should write to the System log.  \\n  \\n You only need to specify an event source if you are writing to an event log. Before writing an entry to an event log, you must register the event source with the event log as a valid source of events. When you write a log entry, the system uses the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Source%2A> property to find the appropriate log in which to place your entry. If you are reading the event log, you can either specify the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Source%2A>, or a <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Log%2A> and <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.MachineName%2A>.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  You are not required to specify the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.MachineName%2A> if you are connecting to a log on the local computer. If you do not specify the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.MachineName%2A>, the local computer (\\\".\\\") is assumed.  \\n  \\n Use <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEvent%2A> and <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEntry%2A> to write events to an event log. You must specify an event source to write events; you must create and configure the event source before writing the first entry with the source.  \\n  \\n Create the new event source during the installation of your application. This allows time for the operating system to refresh its list of registered event sources and their configuration. If the operating system has not refreshed its list of event sources, and you attempt to write an event with the new source, the write operation will fail. You can configure a new source using an <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogInstaller>, or using the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.CreateEventSource%2A> method. You must have administrative rights on the computer to create a new event source.  \\n  \\n You can create an event source for an existing event log or a new event log. When you create a new source for a new event log, the system registers the source for that log, but the log is not created until the first entry is written to it.  \\n  \\n The source must be unique on the local computer; a new source name cannot match an existing source name or an existing event log name. Each source can write to only one event log at a time; however, your application can use multiple sources to write to multiple event logs. For example, your application might require multiple sources configured for different event logs or different resource files.  \\n  \\n If you change the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Source%2A> value, the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog> to which it is registered is closed and all event handles are released.  \\n  \\n The source must be configured either for writing localized entries or for writing direct strings. If your application writes entries using both resource identifiers and string values, you must register two separate sources. For example, configure one source with resource files, and then use that source in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEvent%2A> method to write entries using resource identifiers to the event log. Then create a different source without resource files, and use that source in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEntry%2A> method to write strings directly to the event log using that source.  \\n  \\n To change the configuration details of an existing source, you must delete the source and then create it with the new configuration. If other applications or components use the existing source, create a new source with the updated configuration rather than deleting the existing source.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  If a source has already been mapped to a log and you remap it to a new log, you must restart the computer for the changes to take effect.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following example creates the source `MySource` if it does not already exist, and writes an entry to the event log `MyNewLog`.  \\n  \\n [!code-cpp[Classic EventLog.Source Example#1](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR_Classic/classic EventLog.Source Example/CPP/source.cpp#1)]\\n [!code-csharp[Classic EventLog.Source Example#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_Classic/classic EventLog.Source Example/CS/source.cs#1)]\\n [!code-vb[Classic EventLog.Source Example#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_Classic/classic EventLog.Source Example/VB/source.vb#1)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: >-\n      [System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter(\"System.Diagnostics.Design.StringValueConverter, System.Design, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a\")]\n\n      public string Source { get; set; }\n    return:\n      type: System.String\n      description: The name registered with the event log as a source of entries.

If the event source does not have a configured category resource file, or the specified `category` does not index a string in the category resource file, then the Event Viewer displays the numeric category value for that entry. Configure the category resource file, along with the number of category strings in the resource file, using the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogInstaller> or the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventSourceCreationData> class.  \\n  \\n Event identifiers, together with the event source, uniquely identify an event. Each application can define its own numbered events and the description strings to which they map. Event viewers display these string values to help the user understand what went wrong and suggest what actions to take.  \\n  \\n Finally, you can specify an <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogEntryType> for the event being written to the event log. The `type` is indicated by an icon and text in the Type column in the Event Viewer for a log. This parameter indicates whether the event type is error, warning, information, success audit, or failure audit.  \\n  \\n You must create and configure the event source before writing the first entry with the source. Create the new event source during the installation of your application. This allows time for the operating system to refresh its list of registered event sources and their configuration. If the operating system has not refreshed its list of event sources, and you attempt to write an event with the new source, the write operation will fail. You can configure a new source using an <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogInstaller>, or using the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.CreateEventSource%2A> method. You must have administrative rights on the computer to create a new event source.  \\n  \\n The source must be configured either for writing localized entries or for writing direct strings. The <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEntry%2A> method writes the given string directly to the event log; it does not use a localizable message resource file. Use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEvent%2A> method to write events using a localized message resource file.  \\n  \\n If your application writes entries using both resource identifiers and string values, you must register two separate sources. For example, configure one source with resource files, and then use that source in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEvent%2A> method to write entries using resource identifiers to the event log. Then create a different source without resource files, and use that source in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEntry%2A> method to write strings directly to the event log using that source.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  If the `message` parameter contains a NUL character, the message in the event log is terminated at the NUL character.  \\n>   \\n>  The `message` string cannot contain %*n*, where *n* is an integer value (for example, %1), because the event viewer treats it as an insertion string.

The Event Viewer uses the category to filter events written by an event source. The Event Viewer can display the category as a numeric value, or it can use the category as a resource identifier to display a localized category string.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  The `category` parameter should be a positive value. Negative category values appear as a complementary positive number in the Event Viewer. For example, a –10 appears as 65,526, a –1 as 65,535.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  The `message` string cannot contain %*n*, where *n* is an integer value (for example, %1), because the event viewer treats it as an insertion string. Because an Internet Protocol, version 6 (IPv6) address can contain this character sequence, you cannot log an event message that contains an IPv6 address.  \\n  \\n To display localized category strings in the Event Viewer, you must use an event source configured with a category resource file, and set the `category` to a resource identifier in the category resource file. If the event source does not have a configured category resource file, or the specified `category` does not index a string in the category resource file, then the Event Viewer displays the numeric category value for that entry. Configure the category resource file, along with the number of category strings in the resource file, using the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogInstaller> or the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventSourceCreationData> class.  \\n  \\n In addition to the category, you can specify an event identifier for the event being written to the event log. Event identifiers, along with the event source, uniquely identify an event. Each application can define its own numbered events and the description strings to which they map. Event viewers display these string values to help the user understand what went wrong and suggest what actions to take.  \\n  \\n Finally, you can specify an <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogEntryType> for the event being written to the event log.

Create the new event source during the installation of your application. This allows time for the operating system to refresh its list of registered event sources and their configuration. If the operating system has not refreshed its list of event sources, and you attempt to write an event with the new source, the write operation will fail. You can configure a new source using an <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogInstaller>, or using the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.CreateEventSource%2A> method. You must have administrative rights on the computer to create a new event source.  \\n  \\n The source must be configured either for writing localized entries or for writing direct strings. Use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEntry%2A> method if your application writes string values directly to the event log.  \\n  \\n If your application writes entries using both resource identifiers and string values, you must register two separate sources. For example, configure one source with resource files, and then use that source in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEvent%2A> method to write entries using resource identifiers to the event log.

You specify the event properties with resource identifiers rather than string values. The Event Viewer uses the resource identifiers to display the corresponding strings from the localized resource file for the source. You must register the source with the corresponding resource file before you write events using resource identifiers.  \\n  \\n The input `instance` instance specifies the event message and properties. Set the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventInstance.InstanceId%2A> of the `instance` input for the defined message in the source message resource file. You can optionally set the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventInstance.CategoryId%2A> and <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventInstance.EntryType%2A> of the `instance` input to define the category and event type of your event entry. You can also specify an array of language-independent strings to insert into the localized message text. Set `values` to `null` if the event message does not contain formatting placeholders for replacement strings.  \\n  \\n Specify binary data with an event when it is necessary to provide additional details for the event. For example, use the `data` parameter to include information on a specific error. The Event Viewer does not interpret the associated event data; it displays the data in a combined hexadecimal and text format. Use event-specific data sparingly; include it only if you are sure it will be useful. You can also use event-specific data to store information the application can process independently of the Event Viewer. For example, you could write a viewer specifically for your events, or write a program that scans the event log and creates reports that include information from the event-specific data.  \\n  \\n The specified source must be registered for an event log before using <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEvent%2A>. The specified source must be configured for writing localized entries to the log; the source must at minimum have a message resource file defined.  \\n  \\n You must create and configure the event source before writing the first entry with the source. Create the new event source during the installation of your application. This allows time for the operating system to refresh its list of registered event sources and their configuration. If the operating system has not refreshed its list of event sources, and you attempt to write an event with the new source, the write operation will fail. You can configure a new source using an <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLogInstaller>, or using the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.CreateEventSource%2A> method. You must have administrative rights on the computer to create a new event source.  \\n  \\n The source must be configured either for writing localized entries or for writing direct strings. Use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEntry%2A> method if your application writes string values directly to the event log.  \\n  \\n If your application writes entries using both resource identifiers and string values, you must register two separate sources. For example, configure one source with resource files, and then use that source in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEvent%2A> method to write entries using resource identifiers to the event log. Then create a different source without resource files, and use that source in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEntry%2A> method to write strings directly to the event log using that source.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following example writes an informational event entry and a warning event entry to an existing event log. The event message text is specified using a resource identifier in a resource file. The example assumes the corresponding resource file has been registered for the source.  \\n  \\n [!code-cpp[EventLog_WriteEvent#8](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR/eventlog_WriteEvent/CPP/source.cpp#8)]\\n [!code-csharp[EventLog_WriteEvent#8](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/eventlog_WriteEvent/CS/source.cs#8)]\\n [!code-vb[EventLog_WriteEvent#8](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/eventlog_WriteEvent/VB/source.vb#8)]  \\n  \\n The example uses the following message text file, built into the resource library EventLogMsgs.dll.
