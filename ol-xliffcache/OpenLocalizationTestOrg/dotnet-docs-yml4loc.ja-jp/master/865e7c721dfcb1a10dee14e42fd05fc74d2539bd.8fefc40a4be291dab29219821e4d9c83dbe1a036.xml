class that defines the properties and methods of a security token service (STS).\n  remarks: \"To create an STS you must derive from the <xref:System.IdentityModel.SecurityTokenService> class. In your custom class you must, at a minimum, override the <xref:System.IdentityModel.SecurityTokenService.GetScope%2A> and <xref:System.IdentityModel.SecurityTokenService.GetOutputClaimsIdentity%2A> methods. With these overrides, the STS created using the default implementation of all the other methods defined in the class is capable of issuing security tokens in response to security token requests (RST). That is, the Issue binding defined in the WS-Trust specification is implemented. This binding is implemented in the <xref:System.IdentityModel.SecurityTokenService.Issue%2A> method. None of the other WS-Trust bindings (Renew, Cancel, and Validate) are implemented in the default case and an appropriate fault is returned to the caller if an RST that corresponds to one of these bindings is encountered. You can, of course, override the appropriate methods (<xref:System.IdentityModel.SecurityTokenService.Renew%2A>, <xref:System.IdentityModel.SecurityTokenService.Cancel%2A>, and <xref:System.IdentityModel.SecurityTokenService.Validate%2A>) to implement these bindings in your STS.  \\n  \\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\n>  Implementing a production-ready STS entails careful planning and considerable resources to mitigate the potential security risks inherent in exposing such a service. Most developers using Windows Identity Foundation (WIF) will be developing applications that outsource identity management to an STS, rather than developing an STS itself. WIF provides a Visual Studio extension, the Identity and Access Tool for Visual Studio 2012, to help developers test solutions in the development environment. This tool includes an STS, `LocalSTS`, that you can configure to serve specific claims to the application that you are developing. For more information about the Identity and Access tool, see [Identity and Access Tool for Visual Studio 2012](~/docs/framework/security/identity-and-access-tool-for-vs.md). In some scenarios, `LocalSTS` may not provide the functionality necessary to adequately test your application; for example, in a scenario that involves developing a custom token handler for use by an application. In these cases, you can derive from <xref:System.IdentityModel.SecurityTokenService> to create one or more simple STSs that can be deployed in your development environment and that can be used to test such features in your application. The rest of this section focuses on the methods exposed by the <xref:System.IdentityModel.SecurityTokenService> class that enable you to implement a simple STS and extend the token issuance pipeline.  \\n  \\n The following list provides a brief overview of the methods of primary importance to the developer for use in a test or development environment.  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.IdentityModel.SecurityTokenService.GetScope%2A> method. This method returns a <xref:System.IdentityModel.Scope> object that contains information about the RP. This object is used in the rest of the token issuance pipeline and includes information about the signing and encrypting credentials to use in the response, as well as the `AppliesTo` and `ReplyTo` (if required) addresses. You must override this method.  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.IdentityModel.SecurityTokenService.GetOutputClaimsIdentity%2A> method. This method returns an <xref:System.Security.Claims.ClaimsIdentity> object that contains the claims to return to the RP. You must override this method.  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.IdentityModel.SecurityTokenService.Issue%2A> method. This method implements the token request pipeline, which processes an incoming security token request (RST) and returns a response (RSTR) to the caller that contains a token that can be used to authenticate with an RP. Many of the other methods defined in the <xref:System.IdentityModel.SecurityTokenService> class are called from this method, including the <xref:System.IdentityModel.SecurityTokenService.GetScope%2A> and <xref:System.IdentityModel.SecurityTokenService.GetOutputClaimsIdentity%2A> methods. You do not have to override this method, but an understanding of the token request pipeline it implements may be helpful.  \\n  \\n An STS is configured through the <xref:System.IdentityModel.Configuration.SecurityTokenServiceConfiguration> class.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The code examples that are used in the <xref:System.IdentityModel.SecurityTokenService> topics are taken from the `Custom Token` sample. This sample provides custom classes that enable processing of Simple Web Tokens (SWT) and it includes an implementation of a passive STS that is capable of serving an SWT token. For an example of how to implement an active STS, you can see the `Federation Metadata` sample. For information about these samples and other samples available for WIF and about where to download them, see [WIF Code Sample Index](~/docs/framework/security/wif-code-sample-index.md). The following code shows the implementation of a passive STS using the <xref:System.IdentityModel.SecurityTokenService> class.  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[WIFCustomTokenSTS#3](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/wifcustomtokensts/cs/passivests/customsecuritytokenservice.cs#3)]  \\n  \\n The following code shows how to invoke a custom passive STS to process a WS-Federation request by calling the <xref:System.IdentityModel.Services.FederatedPassiveSecurityTokenServiceOperations.ProcessRequest%28System.Web.HttpRequest%2CSystem.Security.Claims.ClaimsPrincipal%2CSystem.IdentityModel.SecurityTokenService%2CSystem.Web.HttpResponse%29?displayProperty=fullName> method from the code behind in the `default.aspx.cs` file.  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[WIFCustomTokenSTS#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/wifcustomtokensts/cs/passivests/default.aspx.cs#1)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public abstract class SecurityTokenService\n  inheritance:\n  -

It returns an <xref:System.Security.Claims.ClaimsIdentity> that contains the claims to include in the issued security token based on the requestor of the token (the `principal` parameter), the incoming RST (the `request` parameter), and the relying party for which the token is intended (the `scope` parameter). The logic in this method is primarily concerned with answering the following questions:  \\n  \\n-   **Which claim types should be included in the response based on the RP for which it is intended?** Typically this is decided on a per-RP basis from lists of claim types required for each RP or on a per-request basis by examining the <xref:System.IdentityModel.Protocols.WSTrust.RequestSecurityToken.Claims%2A> property of the request. However, the logic and details for determining the claims to include in the response is completely up to your implementation.  \\n  \\n-   **Which claim values should be assigned to the claims in the response?** For an Identity Provider (IP-STS) this typically means using one or more claims in the requestor’s <xref:System.Security.Claims.ClaimsPrincipal> (provided by the `principal` parameter) to access a store (or other entity) to return values for the required claim types. For a Federation Provider (R-STS) this typically means performing some kind of processing on the requestor’s incoming claims to fulfill the request; perhaps performing filtering or transformation on some claims presented by the requestor, while passing others through unmodified. Of course, as in the case of deciding which claims to include in the response, the details and logic of how to determine the values of these claims is up to your implementation.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The code example that is used in this topic is taken from the `Custom Token` sample. This sample provides custom classes that enable processing of Simple Web Tokens (SWT) and it includes an implementation of a passive STS that is capable of serving an SWT token. For an example of how to implement an active STS, you can see the `Federation Metadata` sample. For information about these samples and other samples available for WIF and about where to download them, see [WIF Code Sample Index](~/docs/framework/security/wif-code-sample-index.md). The following code shows how to override the <xref:System.IdentityModel.SecurityTokenService.GetOutputClaimsIdentity%2A> method to return claims for your STS. In this example, the Request Security Token (RST) message is ignored and a collection of claims based on the user as authenticated at the STS is returned.  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[WIFCustomTokenSTS#6](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/wifcustomtokensts/cs/passivests/customsecuritytokenservice.cs#6)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: protected abstract System.Security.Claims.ClaimsIdentity GetOutputClaimsIdentity (System.Security.Claims.ClaimsPrincipal principal, System.IdentityModel.Protocols.WSTrust.RequestSecurityToken request, System.IdentityModel.Scope scope);\n    parameters:\n    - id: principal\n      type: System.Security.Claims.ClaimsPrincipal\n      description: A <xref href=\"System.Security.Claims.ClaimsPrincipal\"></xref> that represents the identity of the token requestor.\n    - id: request\n      type: System.IdentityModel.Protocols.WSTrust.RequestSecurityToken\n      description: A <xref href=\"System.IdentityModel.Protocols.WSTrust.RequestSecurityToken\"></xref> that represents the security token request.
