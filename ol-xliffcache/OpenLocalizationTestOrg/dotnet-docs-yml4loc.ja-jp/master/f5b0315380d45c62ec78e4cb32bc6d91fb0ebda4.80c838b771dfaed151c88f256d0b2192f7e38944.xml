The following illustration shows an example of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Slider> control.  \\n  \\n **Example of a Slider Control**  \\n  \\n ![Slider illustration](~/add/media/genericslider.png \\\"Slider illustration\\\")  \\n  \\n You can customize a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Slider> control by setting its properties. The following list describes some of the attributes of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Slider> that you can customize:  \\n  \\n-   The orientation of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Slider>, either horizontal or vertical.  \\n  \\n-   The tick mark locations along the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Slider> track.  \\n  \\n-   The display of tooltips to show the current value of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Slider>.  \\n  \\n-   The ability of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Thumb> to either snap to tick marks or to be positioned at any point along the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Slider>.  \\n  \\n-   The direction of increasing value along the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Slider>.  \\n  \\n For more information about how to customize a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Slider> control, see the individual member.  \\n  \\n <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Slider> overrides the metadata of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.RangeBase.Maximum%2A> property and sets its default to 10. For more information, see [Dependency Properties Overview](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/dependency-properties-overview.md).  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  If the value of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Slider> is animated, the user may no longer be able to interact with the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Slider> control after the animation finishes. See [How to: Set a Property After Animating It with a Storyboard](~/docs/framework/wpf/graphics-multimedia/how-to-set-a-property-after-animating-it-with-a-storyboard.md) for options of how you can restore user control of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Slider> after it is animated.  \\n  \\n## Customizing the Slider Control  \\n To apply the same property settings to multiple <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Slider> controls, use the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Style%2A> property. You can modify the default <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ControlTemplate> to give the control a unique appearance. For more information about creating a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ControlTemplate>, see [Customizing the Appearance of an Existing Control by Creating a ControlTemplate](~/docs/framework/wpf/controls/customizing-the-appearance-of-an-existing-control.md).  To see the parts and states that are specific to the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Slider>, see [Slider Styles and Templates](~/docs/framework/wpf/controls/slider-styles-and-templates.md).  \\n  \\n Dependency properties for this control might be set by the control’s default style.  If a property is set by a default style, the property might change from its default value when the control appears in the application. The default style is determined by which desktop theme is used when the application is running.  For more information, see [Default WPF Themes](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=158252).  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  Setting a visual property will only have an effect if that property is both present in <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Slider> control's default template and is set by using a .
