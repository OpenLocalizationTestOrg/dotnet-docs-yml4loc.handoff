The example code uses coordinates located in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MouseEventArgs> object passed as a parameter to the event handler to determine the location in the control to obtain the character. The character is then displayed in a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox> if it is not a space character.

A line segment is added to the <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath> for each <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseMove> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseDown> events that occur. To update the graphics, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Invalidate%2A> method is called for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> on each `MouseDown` and `MouseUp` event. In addition, the graphic path is scrolled up or down when the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseWheel> event occurs. Additional mouse events, like <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseHover>, are identified on screen as well.
