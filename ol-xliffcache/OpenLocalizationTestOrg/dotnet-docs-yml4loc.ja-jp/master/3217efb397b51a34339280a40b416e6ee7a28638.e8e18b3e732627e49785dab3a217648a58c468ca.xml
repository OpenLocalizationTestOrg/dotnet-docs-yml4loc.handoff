The connection string builders let developers programmatically create syntactically correct connection strings, and parse and rebuild existing connection strings.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Data.Common.DbConnectionStringBuilder> has been defined in a database-agnostic manner. Because of the addition of the <xref:System.Data.Common> namespace, developers require a base class against which they can program in order to build connection strings that can work against an arbitrary database. Therefore, the <xref:System.Data.Common.DbConnectionStringBuilder> class lets users assign arbitrary key/value pairs and pass the resulting connection string to a strongly typed provider. All the data providers that are included as part of the .NET Framework provide a strongly typed class that inherits from <xref:System.Data.Common.DbConnectionStringBuilder>: <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnectionStringBuilder>, <xref:System.Data.OracleClient.OracleConnectionStringBuilder>, <xref:System.Data.Odbc.OdbcConnectionStringBuilder>, and <xref:System.Data.OleDb.OleDbConnectionStringBuilder>.  \n  \n The developer can build, assign, and edit connection strings for any arbitrary provider.

This means that the class works with Visual Studio designers at design time. When developers use the designer to build strongly typed DataSets and strongly typed connections within Visual Studio, the strongly typed connection string builder class will display the properties associated with its type and will also have converters that can map common values for known keys.  \n  \n Developers needing to create connection strings as part of applications can use the <xref:System.Data.Common.DbConnectionStringBuilder> class or one of its strongly typed derivatives to build and modify connection strings. The <xref:System.Data.Common.DbConnectionStringBuilder> class also makes it easy to manage connection strings stored in an application configuration file.  \n  \n Developers can create connection strings using either a strongly typed connection string builder class, or they can use the <xref:System.Data.Common.DbConnectionStringBuilder> class. The <xref:System.Data.Common.DbConnectionStringBuilder> performs no checks for valid key/value pairs. Therefore, it is possible using this class to create invalid connection strings.

System.Data.Common\n  - System.Data\n  - netstandard\n  namespace: System.Data.Common\n  summary: Provides a base class for strongly typed connection string builders.\n  remarks: \"The <xref:System.Data.Common.DbConnectionStringBuilder> class provides the base class from which the strongly typed connection string builders (<xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnectionStringBuilder>, <xref:System.Data.OleDb.OleDbConnectionStringBuilder>, and so on) derive. The connection string builders let developers programmatically create syntactically correct connection strings, and parse and rebuild existing connection strings.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Data.Common.DbConnectionStringBuilder> has been defined in a database-agnostic manner. Because of the addition of the <xref:System.Data.Common> namespace, developers require a base class against which they can program in order to build connection strings that can work against an arbitrary database. Therefore, the <xref:System.Data.Common.DbConnectionStringBuilder> class lets users assign arbitrary key/value pairs and pass the resulting connection string to a strongly typed provider. All the data providers that are included as part of the .NET Framework provide a strongly typed class that inherits from <xref:System.Data.Common.DbConnectionStringBuilder>: <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnectionStringBuilder>, <xref:System.Data.OracleClient.OracleConnectionStringBuilder>, <xref:System.Data.Odbc.OdbcConnectionStringBuilder>, and <xref:System.Data.OleDb.OleDbConnectionStringBuilder>.  \\n  \\n The developer can build, assign, and edit connection strings for any arbitrary provider. For providers that support specific key/value pairs, the connection string builder provides strongly typed properties corresponding to the known pairs. In order to support providers that require the ability to support unknown values, developers can also supply arbitrary key/value pairs.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Data.Common.DbConnectionStringBuilder> class implements the <xref:System.ComponentModel.ICustomTypeDescriptor> interface. This means that the class works with Visual Studio designers at design time. When developers use the designer to build strongly typed DataSets and strongly typed connections within Visual Studio, the strongly typed connection string builder class will display the properties associated with its type and will also have converters that can map common values for known keys.  \\n  \\n Developers needing to create connection strings as part of applications can use the <xref:System.Data.Common.DbConnectionStringBuilder> class or one of its strongly typed derivatives to build and modify connection strings. The <xref:System.Data.Common.DbConnectionStringBuilder> class also makes it easy to manage connection strings stored in an application configuration file.  \\n  \\n Developers can create connection strings using either a strongly typed connection string builder class, or they can use the <xref:System.Data.Common.DbConnectionStringBuilder> class. The <xref:System.Data.Common.DbConnectionStringBuilder> performs no checks for valid key/value pairs. Therefore, it is possible using this class to create invalid connection strings. The <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnectionStringBuilder> supports only key/value pairs that are supported by SQL Server; trying to add invalid pairs will throw an exception.  \\n  \\n Both the <xref:System.Data.Common.DbConnectionStringBuilder.Add%2A> method and <xref:System.Data.Common.DbConnectionStringBuilder.Item%2A> property handle tries to insert malicious entries. For example, the following code correctly escapes the nested key/value pair:  \\n  \\n```vb  \\nDim builder As New System.Data.Common.DbConnectionStringBuilder  \\nbuilder(\\\"Data Source\\\") = \\\"(local)\\\"  \\nbuilder(\\\"integrated sSecurity\\\") = True  \\nbuilder(\\\"Initial Catalog\\\") = \\\"AdventureWorks;NewValue=Bad\\\"  \\n```  \\n  \\n```csharp  \\nSystem.Data.Common.DbConnectionStringBuilder builder =   \\n    new System.Data.Common.DbConnectionStringBuilder();  \\nbuilder[\\\"Data Source\\\"] = \\\"(local)\\\";  \\nbuilder[\\\"integrated Security\\\"] = true;  \\nbuilder[\\\"Initial Catalog\\\"] = \\\"AdventureWorks;NewValue=Bad\\\";  \\n```  \\n  \\n The result is the following connection string that handles the invalid value in a safe manner:  \\n  \\n```  \\ndata source=(local);integrated security=True;  \\ninitial catalog=\\\"AdventureWorks;NewValue=Bad\\\"  \\n```\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following console application builds two connection strings, one for a Microsoft Jet database, and one for a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](~/includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database. In each case, the code uses a generic <xref:System.Data.Common.DbConnectionStringBuilder> class to create the connection string, and then passes the <xref:System.Data.Common.DbConnectionStringBuilder.ConnectionString%2A> property of the <xref:System.Data.Common.DbConnectionStringBuilder> instance to the constructor of the strongly type connection class. This is not required; the code could also have created individual strongly typed connection string builder instances. The example also parses an existing connection string, and demonstrates various ways of manipulating the connection string's contents.  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[DataWorks DbConnectionStringBuilder#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_ADO.NET/DataWorks DbConnectionStringBuilder/CS/source.cs#1)]\\n [!code-vb[DataWorks DbConnectionStringBuilder#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_ADO.NET/DataWorks DbConnectionStringBuilder/VB/source.vb#1)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: 'public class DbConnectionStringBuilder : System.Collections.IDictionary, System.ComponentModel.ICustomTypeDescriptor'\n  inheritance:\n  -
