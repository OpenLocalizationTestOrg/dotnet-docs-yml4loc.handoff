System.Windows.Forms\n  namespace: System.Windows.Forms\n  summary: Provides information that accessibility applications use to adjust an application's user interface (UI) for users with impairments.\n  remarks: \"Accessibility applications can adjust features of the application to improve usability for users with disabilities.  \\n  \\n For users who are visually impaired, you can adjust software and operating system features to comply with their needs. For example, you can enlarge text and images and render them with a contrast. In addition, you can accommodate color-blindness with the appropriate use of colors. For users who are severely visually impaired, computers are accessible with screen review aids that translate on-screen text to speech or to a dynamic, refreshable, Braille display.  \\n  \\n For users who are hard of hearing, you can design programs that use visual cues, such as a flashing toolbar; or you can display spoken messages as text. For example, when turned on, the `SoundSentry` feature, an accessibility option in Control Panel, provides a visual warning whenever the system makes an alarm sound.  \\n  \\n For users with motion disabilities, you can design controls that refine or eliminate keyboard and mouse use, thereby improving computer accessibility. Control Panel offers assistance. For example, one alternative is to use the numeric keypad instead of the mouse for navigation. Another option, called `StickyKeys`, enables users who cannot hold down two or more keys at a time (such as CTRL+P) to get the same result by typing one key at a time.  \\n  \\n For users with cognitive and language disabilities, you can design software programs to better accommodate their needs. For example, using conspicuous or cued sequencing, uncomplicated displays, fewer words, and a reading level targeted to elementary school standards can benefit these users.  \\n  \\n For users with seizure disorders, you can design software programs to eliminate seizure provoking patterns.  \\n  \\n For more information about accessibility, including information about accessibility applications, see the documentation for Microsoft Accessibility in the MSDN library or at the Microsoft Web site.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  To use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.AccessibleObject>, you must add a reference to the `Accessibility` assembly installed with the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)]. Windows Forms only supports Active Accessibility 2.0.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example demonstrates the creation of an accessibility-aware chart control, using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.AccessibleObject> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.ControlAccessibleObject> classes to expose accessible information. The control plots two curves along with a legend. The `ChartControlAccessibleObject` class, which derives from `ControlAccessibleObject`, is used in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.CreateAccessibilityInstance%2A> method to provide custom accessible information for the chart control.
