The following code example shows a font reference that is composed of a base [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] value and a relative [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] value.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[FontSnippets#FontPackageSnippet2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/FontSnippets/CSharp/FontPackageSnippets.xaml.cs#fontpackagesnippet2)]\n [!code-vb[FontSnippets#FontPackageSnippet2](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/FontSnippets/visualbasic/fontpackagesnippets.xaml.vb#fontpackagesnippet2)]  \n  \n When a <xref:System.Windows.Media.FontFamily> is specified as an attribute in markup, the base [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] value is always implied—its value is the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] of the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_titlexaml](~/includes/tlasharptla-titlexaml-md.md)] page.

In the following [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](~/includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)] example, notice that the relative [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] value uses the \"./\" notation, which means \"in the current folder\" of the base [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] value.  \n  \n [!code-xml[FontSnippets#FontPackageSnippet1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/FontSnippets/CSharp/FontPackageSnippets.xaml#fontpackagesnippet1)]  \n  \n A [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] application can package fonts as either a content item, a resource item, or a library resource item. For more information, see [Packaging Fonts with Applications](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/packaging-fonts-with-applications.md).  \n  \n## Font Fallback  \n Font fallback refers to the automatic substitution of a font other than the font that is selected by the client application. There are two primary reasons why font fallback is invoked:  \n  \n-   The font that is specified by the client application does not exist on the system.  \n  \n-   The font that is specified by the client application does not contain the glyphs that are required to render text.  \n  \n In[!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)], the font fallback mechanism uses the default fallback font family, \"Global User Interface\", as the substitute font. This font is defined as a composite font, whose file name is \"GlobalUserInterface.CompositeFont\". For more information about composite fonts, see the Composite Fonts section in this topic.  \n  \n The [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] font fallback mechanism replaces previous [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_win32](~/includes/tlasharptla-win32-md.md)] font substitution technologies.  \n  \n## Defining a Font Fallback Sequence in Code  \n You can define a font fallback sequence in your code, which lets you define an alternate font. When you create a <xref:System.Windows.Media.FontFamily> object, provide multiple font family names, separated by commas, for the <xref:System.String> parameter, such as \"Comic Sans MS, Verdana\". In this case, if the glyphs from the \"Comic Sans MS\" typeface are not available, glyphs from the \"Verdana\" typeface are used. If neither \"Comic Sans MS\" nor \"Verdana\" have the required glyphs, the fallback font family of the typeface is used, which is \"Global User Interface\" by default.  \n  \n The following examples show how to define a font fallback sequence, in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](~/includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)] and in code.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[FontSnippets#FontFallbackSnippet1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/FontSnippets/CSharp/FontFamilySnippets.xaml.cs#fontfallbacksnippet1)]\n [!code-vb[FontSnippets#FontFallbackSnippet1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/FontSnippets/visualbasic/fontfamilysnippets.xaml.vb#fontfallbacksnippet1)]\n [!code-xml[FontSnippets#FontFallbackSnippet1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/FontSnippets/CSharp/FontFamilySnippets.xaml#fontfallbacksnippet1)]  \n  \n Any one of the fonts in the fallback sequence can specify font locations. In the following examples, \"Pericles Light\" is referenced as an application resource, and \"Verdana\" is referenced as a system font collection member.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[FontSnippets#FontFallbackSnippet2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/FontSnippets/CSharp/FontFamilySnippets.xaml.cs#fontfallbacksnippet2)]\n [!code-vb[FontSnippets#FontFallbackSnippet2](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/FontSnippets/visualbasic/fontfamilysnippets.xaml.vb#fontfallbacksnippet2)]\n [!code-xml[FontSnippets#FontFallbackSnippet2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/FontSnippets/CSharp/FontFamilySnippets.xaml#fontfallbacksnippet2)]  \n  \n## Composite Fonts  \n The [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] platform provides a composite font feature to allow the construction of full range multilingual fonts, and to avoid displaying missing glyphs. Composite fonts replace the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_win32](~/includes/tla2sharptla-win32-md.md)] font linking, font fallback, font binding, font association, and end-user-defined characters (EUDC) mechanisms.  \n  \n A composite font family is available to applications through the <xref:System.Windows.Media.FontFamily> and <xref:System.Windows.Media.Typeface> constructors just like any other font family. Each composite font family is named, and, as with other fonts, can provide localized variants of its name in multiple languages.  \n  \n The following markup example shows how a composite font family can be defined as a disk file. This file can be stored in the default [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] font directory as with any other installed font, or can be referenced in any location by including its [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] when referencing the family by name.  \n  \n The following example shows the font family markup in a \".CompositeFont\" file.  \n  \n [!code-xml[CompositeFontMarkup#CF](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/CompositeFontMarkup/CS/comp.xaml#cf)]  \n  \n The following four composite fonts appear in the default [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_win](~/includes/tla2sharptla-win-md.md)] font directory as part of the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] installation.  \n  \n|Font|Notes|  \n|----------|-----------|  \n|GlobalMonospace.CompositeFont|Renders text by using a monospace font, for example, \"Courier New\" for Latin characters.|  \n|GlobalSanSerif.CompositeFont|Renders text by using a sans serif font, for example, \"Arial\" for Latin characters.|  \n|GlobalSerif.CompositeFont|Renders text by using a serif font, for example, \"Times New Roman\" for Latin characters.|  \n|GlobalUserInterface.CompositeFont|Renders text by using a default font, for example, \"Times New Roman\" for Latin characters.|  \n  \n<a name=\"xamlAttributeUsage_FontFamily\"></a>   \n## XAML Attribute Usage  \n  \n```  \n<object FontFamily=\"fontFamilyName\"/>  \n- or -  \n<object FontFamily=\"fontFamilyNamesList\"/>  \n- or -  \n<object FontFamily=\"fontFamilyFolderReference\"/>  \n- or -  \n<object FontFamily=\"fontFamilyUriReference\"/>  \n```  \n  \n<a name=\"xamlValues_FontFamily\"></a>   \n## XAML Values  \n *fontFamilyName*  \n A string specifying a font family name.  For example, `\"Arial\"` or `\"Century Gothic\"`.  \n  \n *fontFamilyNamesList*  \n A string specifying multiple font family names, each separated by a comma (any whitespace following a comma is ignored).  The first font family specified serves as the primary font family; subsequent font families serve as fallback families to be used in cases where the primary font family is unavailable or not applicable.  For example, `\"Arial, Century Gothic\"` specifies Arial as the primary font family, with Century Gothic as the fallback font family.  \n  \n *fontFamilyFolderReference*  \n A string specifying a folder containing the font, along with a font family name.  The folder and font family name are delimited by a # character.  The folder reference may be absolute, or relative.  For example, `\"Custom Fonts\\#My Custom Font\"`.  \n  \n *fontFamilyUriReference*  \n A string specifying a [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_uri](~/includes/tlasharptla-uri-md.md)] for the font, along with a font family name.

remarks: \"A font family is a set of typefaces that share the same family name, such as \\\"Times New Roman\\\", but that differ in features. These feature differences include <xref:System.Windows.Media.Typeface.Style%2A>, such as italic, and <xref:System.Windows.Media.Typeface.Weight%2A>, such as bold.  \\n  \\n ![Fonts](~/add/media/fonts.PNG \\\"Fonts\\\")  \\nExample of typefaces that are members of the \\\"Times New Roman\\\" font family  \\n  \\n Most [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_ui](~/includes/tlasharptla-ui-md.md)] elements, such as <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock>, provide a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.FontFamily%2A> property that can be used to specify a font for the text content of a control. You define the font by setting that property with a <xref:System.Windows.Media.FontFamily> value. The following examples show how to reference a font, in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](~/includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)] and in code.  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[FontSnippets#FontFallbackSnippet3](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/FontSnippets/CSharp/FontFamilySnippets.xaml.cs#fontfallbacksnippet3)]\\n [!code-vb[FontSnippets#FontFallbackSnippet3](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/FontSnippets/visualbasic/fontfamilysnippets.xaml.vb#fontfallbacksnippet3)]\\n [!code-xml[FontSnippets#FontFallbackSnippet3](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/FontSnippets/CSharp/FontFamilySnippets.xaml#fontfallbacksnippet3)]  \\n  \\n In the preceding example, the font that is referenced, \\\"Comic Sans MS\\\", is referred to by its *friendly name*. Also, in this example the font is assumed to be in the system font collection.  \\n  \\n## Specifying Fonts in Alternate Directories  \\n A [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](~/includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] application can specify a directory, other than the directory that contains the systems font collection, for resolving font references. The friendly name of the font can specify an absolute [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_uri](~/includes/tlasharptla-uri-md.md)] value to resolve the font reference, as shown in the following [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](~/includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)] and code examples.  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[FontSnippets#FontPackageSnippet6](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/FontSnippets/CSharp/FontPackageSnippets.xaml.cs#fontpackagesnippet6)]\\n [!code-vb[FontSnippets#FontPackageSnippet6](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/FontSnippets/visualbasic/fontpackagesnippets.xaml.vb#fontpackagesnippet6)]\\n [!code-xml[FontSnippets#FontPackageSnippet6](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/FontSnippets/CSharp/FontPackageSnippets.xaml#fontpackagesnippet6)]  \\n  \\n The friendly name of the font can also specify a relative [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] value, which requires a base [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] to resolve the font reference. The <xref:System.Windows.Media.FontFamily.BaseUri%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Media.FontFamily> object corresponds to the base [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] value. The following code example shows how to create a font reference that is composed of a base [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] value and a relative [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] value.  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[FontSnippets#FontPackageSnippet7](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/FontSnippets/CSharp/FontPackageSnippets.xaml.cs#fontpackagesnippet7)]\\n [!code-vb[FontSnippets#FontPackageSnippet7](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/FontSnippets/visualbasic/fontpackagesnippets.xaml.vb#fontpackagesnippet7)]  \\n  \\n You can use a base [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] value when you reference a font that is packaged as part of the application. For example, the base [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] value can be a \\\"pack://application\\\" [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)], which lets you reference fonts that are packaged as application resources. The following code example shows a font reference that is composed of a base [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] value and a relative [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] value.  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[FontSnippets#FontPackageSnippet2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/FontSnippets/CSharp/FontPackageSnippets.xaml.cs#fontpackagesnippet2)]\\n [!code-vb[FontSnippets#FontPackageSnippet2](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/FontSnippets/visualbasic/fontpackagesnippets.xaml.vb#fontpackagesnippet2)]  \\n  \\n When a <xref:System.Windows.Media.FontFamily> is specified as an attribute in markup, the base [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] value is always implied—its value is the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] of the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_titlexaml](~/includes/tlasharptla-titlexaml-md.md)] page. The implied base [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] value is used with the relative [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] value in the friendly name string to obtain the location of the font. In the following [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](~/includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)] example, notice that the relative [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] value uses the \\\"./\\\" notation, which means \\\"in the current folder\\\" of the base [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] value.  \\n  \\n [!code-xml[FontSnippets#FontPackageSnippet1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/FontSnippets/CSharp/FontPackageSnippets.xaml#fontpackagesnippet1)]  \\n  \\n A [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] application can package fonts as either a content item, a resource item, or a library resource item. For more information, see [Packaging Fonts with Applications](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/packaging-fonts-with-applications.md).  \\n  \\n## Font Fallback  \\n Font fallback refers to the automatic substitution of a font other than the font that is selected by the client application. There are two primary reasons why font fallback is invoked:  \\n  \\n-   The font that is specified by the client application does not exist on the system.  \\n  \\n-   The font that is specified by the client application does not contain the glyphs that are required to render text.  \\n  \\n In[!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)], the font fallback mechanism uses the default fallback font family, \\\"Global User Interface\\\", as the substitute font. This font is defined as a composite font, whose file name is \\\"GlobalUserInterface.CompositeFont\\\". For more information about composite fonts, see the Composite Fonts section in this topic.  \\n  \\n The [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] font fallback mechanism replaces previous [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_win32](~/includes/tlasharptla-win32-md.md)] font substitution technologies.  \\n  \\n## Defining a Font Fallback Sequence in Code  \\n You can define a font fallback sequence in your code, which lets you define an alternate font. When you create a <xref:System.Windows.Media.FontFamily> object, provide multiple font family names, separated by commas, for the <xref:System.String> parameter, such as \\\"Comic Sans MS, Verdana\\\". In this case, if the glyphs from the \\\"Comic Sans MS\\\" typeface are not available, glyphs from the \\\"Verdana\\\" typeface are used. If neither \\\"Comic Sans MS\\\" nor \\\"Verdana\\\" have the required glyphs, the fallback font family of the typeface is used, which is \\\"Global User Interface\\\" by default.  \\n  \\n The following examples show how to define a font fallback sequence, in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](~/includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)] and in code.  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[FontSnippets#FontFallbackSnippet1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/FontSnippets/CSharp/FontFamilySnippets.xaml.cs#fontfallbacksnippet1)]\\n [!code-vb[FontSnippets#FontFallbackSnippet1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/FontSnippets/visualbasic/fontfamilysnippets.xaml.vb#fontfallbacksnippet1)]\\n [!code-xml[FontSnippets#FontFallbackSnippet1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/FontSnippets/CSharp/FontFamilySnippets.xaml#fontfallbacksnippet1)]  \\n  \\n Any one of the fonts in the fallback sequence can specify font locations.

Composite fonts replace the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_win32](~/includes/tla2sharptla-win32-md.md)] font linking, font fallback, font binding, font association, and end-user-defined characters (EUDC) mechanisms.  \\n  \\n A composite font family is available to applications through the <xref:System.Windows.Media.FontFamily> and <xref:System.Windows.Media.Typeface> constructors just like any other font family. Each composite font family is named, and, as with other fonts, can provide localized variants of its name in multiple languages.  \\n  \\n The following markup example shows how a composite font family can be defined as a disk file. This file can be stored in the default [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] font directory as with any other installed font, or can be referenced in any location by including its [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] when referencing the family by name.  \\n  \\n The following example shows the font family markup in a \\\".CompositeFont\\\" file.  \\n  \\n [!code-xml[CompositeFontMarkup#CF](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/CompositeFontMarkup/CS/comp.xaml#cf)]  \\n  \\n The following four composite fonts appear in the default [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_win](~/includes/tla2sharptla-win-md.md)] font directory as part of the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] installation.  \\n  \\n|Font|Notes|  \\n|----------|-----------|  \\n|GlobalMonospace.CompositeFont|Renders text by using a monospace font, for example, \\\"Courier New\\\" for Latin characters.|  \\n|GlobalSanSerif.CompositeFont|Renders text by using a sans serif font, for example, \\\"Arial\\\" for Latin characters.|  \\n|GlobalSerif.CompositeFont|Renders text by using a serif font, for example, \\\"Times New Roman\\\" for Latin characters.|  \\n|GlobalUserInterface.CompositeFont|Renders text by using a default font, for example, \\\"Times New Roman\\\" for Latin characters.|  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"xamlAttributeUsage_FontFamily\\\"></a>   \\n## XAML Attribute Usage  \\n  \\n```  \\n<object FontFamily=\\\"fontFamilyName\\\"/>  \\n- or -  \\n<object FontFamily=\\\"fontFamilyNamesList\\\"/>  \\n- or -  \\n<object FontFamily=\\\"fontFamilyFolderReference\\\"/>  \\n- or -  \\n<object FontFamily=\\\"fontFamilyUriReference\\\"/>  \\n```  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"xamlValues_FontFamily\\\"></a>   \\n## XAML Values  \\n *fontFamilyName*  \\n A string specifying a font family name.

The first font family specified serves as the primary font family; subsequent font families serve as fallback families to be used in cases where the primary font family is unavailable or not applicable.  For example, `\\\"Arial, Century Gothic\\\"` specifies Arial as the primary font family, with Century Gothic as the fallback font family.  \\n  \\n *fontFamilyFolderReference*  \\n A string specifying a folder containing the font, along with a font family name.  The folder and font family name are delimited by a # character.  The folder reference may be absolute, or relative.  For example, `\\\"Custom Fonts\\\\#My Custom Font\\\"`.  \\n  \\n *fontFamilyUriReference*  \\n A string specifying a [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_uri](~/includes/tlasharptla-uri-md.md)] for the font, along with a font family name.
