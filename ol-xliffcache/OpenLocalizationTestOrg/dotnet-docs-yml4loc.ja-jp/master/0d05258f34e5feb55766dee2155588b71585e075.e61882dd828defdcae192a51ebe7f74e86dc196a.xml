When you use the <xref:System.Web.UI.Timer> control as a trigger for an <xref:System.Web.UI.UpdatePanel> control, the <xref:System.Web.UI.UpdatePanel> control is updated by using an asynchronous, partial-page update. You must include a <xref:System.Web.UI.ScriptManager> object in a Web page to use the <xref:System.Web.UI.Timer> control.  \n  \n You use the <xref:System.Web.UI.Timer> control to update an <xref:System.Web.UI.UpdatePanel> control by including the timer inside the <xref:System.Web.UI.UpdatePanel> control. Alternatively, you can place the timer outside the <xref:System.Web.UI.UpdatePanel> control and set the timer as a trigger.  \n  \n You can also initiate full postback of a complete Web page by including the <xref:System.Web.UI.Timer> control in the Web page and not setting it as a trigger for an <xref:System.Web.UI.UpdatePanel> control.  \n  \n You can run server code when the timer interval has elapsed by creating an event handler for the <xref:System.Web.UI.Timer.Tick> event. In the event handler, you can include code that dynamically adjusts the behavior of the <xref:System.Web.UI.Timer> control.  \n  \n Set the <xref:System.Web.UI.Timer.Interval%2A> property to specify how often postbacks will occur. Set the <xref:System.Web.UI.Timer.Enabled%2A> property to turn the <xref:System.Web.UI.Timer> on or off.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The accuracy of when the <xref:System.Web.UI.Timer> control posts back to the Web server depends on the accuracy of the ECMAScript (JavaScript) `window.setTimeout` function that is running in the browser.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Web.UI.Timer.Interval%2A> property is defined in milliseconds. You must set the <xref:System.Web.UI.Timer.Interval%2A> property to a value that lets at least one asynchronous postback complete before the next postback is initiated. When the <xref:System.Web.UI.Timer> control is outside an <xref:System.Web.UI.UpdatePanel> control, the timer continues to run while the content of the <xref:System.Web.UI.UpdatePanel> control is refreshed. If a new postback is initiated while an earlier postback is being processed, the first postback will be canceled. The default value is 60,000 milliseconds (60 seconds).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Adding a <xref:System.Web.UI.Timer> control with a small value in the <xref:System.Web.UI.Timer.Interval%2A> property can generate significant traffic to and from the Web server.

When you use the <xref:System.Web.UI.Timer> control as a trigger for an <xref:System.Web.UI.UpdatePanel> control, the <xref:System.Web.UI.UpdatePanel> control is updated by using an asynchronous, partial-page update. You must include a <xref:System.Web.UI.ScriptManager> object in a Web page to use the <xref:System.Web.UI.Timer> control.  \\n  \\n You use the <xref:System.Web.UI.Timer> control to update an <xref:System.Web.UI.UpdatePanel> control by including the timer inside the <xref:System.Web.UI.UpdatePanel> control. Alternatively, you can place the timer outside the <xref:System.Web.UI.UpdatePanel> control and set the timer as a trigger.  \\n  \\n You can also initiate full postback of a complete Web page by including the <xref:System.Web.UI.Timer> control in the Web page and not setting it as a trigger for an <xref:System.Web.UI.UpdatePanel> control.  \\n  \\n You can run server code when the timer interval has elapsed by creating an event handler for the <xref:System.Web.UI.Timer.Tick> event. In the event handler, you can include code that dynamically adjusts the behavior of the <xref:System.Web.UI.Timer> control.  \\n  \\n Set the <xref:System.Web.UI.Timer.Interval%2A> property to specify how often postbacks will occur. Set the <xref:System.Web.UI.Timer.Enabled%2A> property to turn the <xref:System.Web.UI.Timer> on or off.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  The accuracy of when the <xref:System.Web.UI.Timer> control posts back to the Web server depends on the accuracy of the ECMAScript (JavaScript) `window.setTimeout` function that is running in the browser.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Web.UI.Timer.Interval%2A> property is defined in milliseconds. You must set the <xref:System.Web.UI.Timer.Interval%2A> property to a value that lets at least one asynchronous postback complete before the next postback is initiated. When the <xref:System.Web.UI.Timer> control is outside an <xref:System.Web.UI.UpdatePanel> control, the timer continues to run while the content of the <xref:System.Web.UI.UpdatePanel> control is refreshed. If a new postback is initiated while an earlier postback is being processed, the first postback will be canceled. The default value is 60,000 milliseconds (60 seconds).  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  Adding a <xref:System.Web.UI.Timer> control with a small value in the <xref:System.Web.UI.Timer.Interval%2A> property can generate significant traffic to and from the Web server. Use the <xref:System.Web.UI.Timer> control to refresh the content only as often as necessary.  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"declarative_syntax\\\"></a>   \\n## Declarative Syntax  \\n  \\n```  \\n<asp:Timer  \\n    Enabled=\\\"True|False\\\"  \\n    EnableTheming=\\\"True|False\\\"  \\n    EnableViewState=\\\"True|False\\\"  \\n    ID=\\\"string\\\"  \\n    Interval=\\\"integer\\\"  \\n    OnDataBinding=\\\"DataBinding event handler\\\"  \\n    OnDisposed=\\\"Disposed event handler\\\"  \\n    OnInit=\\\"Init event handler\\\"  \\n    OnLoad=\\\"Load event handler\\\"  \\n    OnPreRender=\\\"PreRender event handler\\\"  \\n    OnTick=\\\"Tick event handler\\\"  \\n    OnUnload=\\\"Unload handler\\\"  \\n    runat=\\\"server\\\"  \\n    SkinID=\\\"string\\\"  \\n    Visible=\\\"True|False\\\"  \\n/>  \\n```\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following example shows an <xref:System.Web.UI.UpdatePanel> control that displays a randomly generated stock price and the time that the stock price was generated.

Because each timer interval causes a postback that causes network traffic, in a production application you should set the interval to the longest time that is still practical for your application.  \\n  \\n <!-- TODO: review snippet reference [!code-csharp[System.Web.UI.Controls.Timer#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Atlas/System.Web.UI.Controls.Timer/cs/Default.aspx#1)]  -->\\n <!-- TODO: review snippet reference [!code-vb[System.Web.UI.Controls.Timer#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Atlas/System.Web.UI.Controls.Timer/vb/Default.aspx#1)]  -->\"\n  syntax:\n    content: >-\n      [System.Drawing.ToolboxBitmap(typeof(EmbeddedResourceFinder), \"System.Web.Resources.Timer.bmp\")]\n\n      public class Timer : System.Web.UI.Control, System.Web.UI.IPostBackEventHandler, System.Web.UI.IScriptControl\n  inheritance:\n  -
