This class cannot be inherited.\n  remarks: \"You can configure your [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](~/includes/ndptecclick-md.md)] application to check for updates and install them automatically through the `subscription` element of the deployment manifest. Some applications, however, need finer control over their updates. You may want to install required updates programmatically, and prompt users to install optional updates at their convenience. By turning off subscription updates in the deployment manifest, you can take complete control of your application's update policies. Alternatively, you can use automatic subscription in conjunction with <xref:System.Deployment.Application.ApplicationDeployment>, which enables [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](~/includes/ndptecclick-md.md)] to update the application periodically, but uses <xref:System.Deployment.Application.ApplicationDeployment> to download critical updates shortly after they are released.  \\n  \\n You can test whether your deployment has an available update by using either the <xref:System.Deployment.Application.ApplicationDeployment.CheckForUpdate%2A> or the <xref:System.Deployment.Application.ApplicationDeployment.CheckForUpdateAsync%2A> method; the latter method raises the <xref:System.Deployment.Application.ApplicationDeployment.CheckForUpdateCompleted> event on successful completion. <xref:System.Deployment.Application.ApplicationDeployment.CheckForDetailedUpdate%2A> returns important information about the update, such as its version number and whether it is a required update for current users. If an update is available, you can install it by using <xref:System.Deployment.Application.ApplicationDeployment.Update%2A> or <xref:System.Deployment.Application.ApplicationDeployment.UpdateAsync%2A>; the latter method raises the <xref:System.Deployment.Application.ApplicationDeployment.UpdateCompleted> event after installation of the update is complete. For large updates, you can receive progress notifications through the <xref:System.Deployment.Application.ApplicationDeployment.CheckForUpdateProgressChanged> and <xref:System.Deployment.Application.ApplicationDeployment.UpdateProgressChanged> events, and use the information in <xref:System.ComponentModel.ProgressChangedEventArgs> to notify the user of the download status.  \\n  \\n You can also use <xref:System.Deployment.Application.ApplicationDeployment> to download large files and assemblies on demand. These files must be marked as \\\"optional\\\" within the deployment's application manifest so that they are not downloaded during installation. You can download the files at any point during the application's duration by using the <xref:System.Deployment.Application.ApplicationDeployment.DownloadFileGroup%2A> or the <xref:System.Deployment.Application.ApplicationDeployment.DownloadFileGroupAsync%2A> method. You can download assemblies before they are loaded into memory by supplying an event handler for the <xref:System.AppDomain.AssemblyResolve> event on the <xref:System.AppDomain> class. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Downloading Assemblies on Demand with the ClickOnce Deployment API Using the Designer](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/59a0dd5f-1cab-4f2f-b780-0ab7399905d5).  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  If you update a [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](~/includes/ndptecclick-md.md)] application while the application is running, the user will not see the updates until you call the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Application.Restart%2A> method of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Application>, which will close the current running instance of the application and immediately restart it.  \\n  \\n <xref:System.Deployment.Application.ApplicationDeployment> has no public constructor; you obtain instances of the class within a [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](~/includes/ndptecclick-md.md)] application through the <xref:System.Deployment.Application.ApplicationDeployment.CurrentDeployment%2A> property. You use the <xref:System.Deployment.Application.ApplicationDeployment.IsNetworkDeployed%2A> property to verify that the current application is a [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](~/includes/ndptecclick-md.md)] application.  \\n  \\n <xref:System.Deployment.Application.ApplicationDeployment> supports checking for updates and downloading updated files asynchronously by using the new [Event-based Asynchronous Pattern Overview](~/docs/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/event-based-asynchronous-pattern-overview.md), which exposes completion callbacks as class events. <xref:System.Deployment.Application.ApplicationDeployment> starts and manages the threads for you, and calls your application back on the correct UI thread. Through this class, you can update without locking up the application, so that the user can continue working while the update installs. If the user must stop all work while an update takes place, consider using the synchronous methods instead.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  Performing asynchronous updates requires that your application import both the <xref:System.Deployment.Application> and <xref:System.ComponentModel> namespaces.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example determines at application load time whether a new update is available; if a required update is available, the code example installs the update asynchronously.
