This can be used to ensure that an operation has a certain configuration setting enabled, supports a particular feature and other requirements.  \\n  \\n <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.IOperationBehavior> objects can make use of any of these methods, but often only one is important; in such cases, the unused methods can return, performing no action.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  All of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.IOperationBehavior> methods pass an <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.OperationDescription> object as a parameter. This parameter is for examination only; if you modify the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.OperationDescription> object the execution behavior is undefined.  \\n  \\n <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.IOperationBehavior> objects are typically used to access the various properties of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.DispatchOperation?displayProperty=fullName> object in a service application and the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.ClientOperation?displayProperty=fullName> object in a client application.  \\n  \\n Typically, the developer first reviews the extensibility points to determine which customization option suits the application scenario and then implements the customization at the appropriate scope. For example, <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.IServiceBehavior?displayProperty=fullName> objects can insert customizations for all messages in an entire service and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.IContractBehavior?displayProperty=fullName> objects can insert customizations for all messages across a specific contract, and so on. For a description of the various properties and customizations available, see [Extending ServiceHost and the Service Model Layer](~/docs/framework/wcf/extending/extending-servicehost-and-the-service-model-layer.md).  \\n  \\n Once a customization has been decided upon (and the customization interface implemented if necessary) and the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.IOperationBehavior> is the appropriate scope of customization, the customization must be inserted into the [!INCLUDE[indigo1](~/includes/indigo1-md.md)] runtime by implementing <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.IOperationBehavior> and adding the operation behavior to the runtime.  \\n  \\n There are two ways to add the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.IOperationBehavior> to the runtime:  \\n  \\n-   Programmatically add the custom operation behavior to the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.OperationDescription.Behaviors%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property prior to the opening of the service host (in a service application) or the channel factory (in a client application).  \\n  \\n-   Add the behavior using a custom attribute.  \\n  \\n To perform the service customization task for which it is intended, the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.IOperationBehavior> object must be added to the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.OperationDescription.Behaviors%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property prior to the construction of the service runtime, which occurs when <xref:System.ServiceModel.ICommunicationObject.Open%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method is called on <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceHost?displayProperty=fullName>. To perform a client customization task, the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.IOperationBehavior> object must be added to the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.OperationDescription.Behaviors%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property before calling the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ChannelFactory%601.CreateChannel%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method or the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ICommunicationObject.Open%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method on <xref:System.ServiceModel.ChannelFactory%601>.  \\n  \\n Although the operation behavior is designed for easy access to the runtime at the scope of an individual operation, you can access the runtime at a larger scope by accessing the parent runtime object.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example shows an implementation of <xref:System.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.IParameterInspector?displayProperty=fullName> that writes to the console when the inspector is invoked on an operation.
