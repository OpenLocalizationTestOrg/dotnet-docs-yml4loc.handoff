These binding elements extend the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.StreamUpgradeBindingElement> class that is called to build the client and server stream upgrade providers.  \n  \n A custom binding contains a collection of binding elements arranged in a specific order: the element that represents the top of the binding stack is added first, the next element down in the binding stack is added second, and so on.  \n  \n### To add this class to a binding  \n  \n1.  Create a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingElementCollection>.  \n  \n2.

System.ServiceModel\n  namespace: System.ServiceModel.Channels\n  summary: Represents a custom binding element that supports channel security using an SSL stream.\n  remarks: \"Transports that use a stream-oriented protocol such as TCP and named pipes support stream-based transport upgrades. Specifically, [!INCLUDE[indigo1](~/includes/indigo1-md.md)] provides security upgrades. The configuration of this transport security is encapsulated by this class as well as by <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.SslStreamSecurityBindingElement>, which can be configured and added to a custom binding. In addition, a third party can write their own custom `StreamSecurityBindingElement`. These binding elements extend the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.StreamUpgradeBindingElement> class that is called to build the client and server stream upgrade providers.  \\n  \\n A custom binding contains a collection of binding elements arranged in a specific order: the element that represents the top of the binding stack is added first, the next element down in the binding stack is added second, and so on.  \\n  \\n### To add this class to a binding  \\n  \\n1.  Create a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingElementCollection>.  \\n  \\n2.  Create custom binding elements that are above this binding element in the binding stack, such as the optional <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.TransactionFlowBindingElement> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.ReliableSessionBindingElement>.  \\n  \\n3.  Add the created elements in the order described previously to the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingElementCollection> using the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingElementCollection.InsertItem%2A> method.  \\n  \\n4.  Create an instance of <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.SslStreamSecurityBindingElement> and add it to the collection.  \\n  \\n5.  Add any additional custom binding elements to the collection, such as <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.TcpTransportBindingElement>.  \\n  \\n There are three scenarios in which you must either manually specify the correct UPN/SPN on the client endpoint after importing the WSDL, or specify a custom <xref:System.ServiceModel.Security.IdentityVerifier> on the client’s <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.SslStreamSecurityBindingElement>.  \\n  \\n1.  No service identity is published in WSDL. <xref:System.ServiceModel.Configuration.AuthenticationMode.SspiNegotiatedOverTransport> and HTTPS are used (for example, a <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSHttpBinding> with SecurityMode = <xref:System.ServiceModel.SecurityMode.TransportWithMessageCredential>). If the service is not running with the machine identity, you must manually specify the correct UPN/SPN on the client endpoint after importing the WSDL.  \\n  \\n2.  DNSservice identity is published in WSDL. <xref:System.ServiceModel.Configuration.AuthenticationMode.SspiNegotiatedOverTransport> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.SslStreamSecurityBindingElement> are used (for example, <xref:System.ServiceModel.NetTcpBinding> with SecurityMode = <xref:System.ServiceModel.SecurityMode.TransportWithMessageCredential>) instead of a UPN/SPN. If the service is not running with the machine identity, or the DNS identity is not the machine's identity, you must manually specify the correct UPN/SPN on the client endpoint after importing the WSDL.  \\n  \\n3.  DNS identity is published in WSDL. If <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.SslStreamSecurityBindingElement> is overridden on the client, you must specify a custom <xref:System.ServiceModel.Security.IdentityVerifier> on the client's <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.SslStreamSecurityBindingElement>.  \\n  \\n The following code shows how to manually specify the correct UPN/SPN on the client endpoint, as well as how to specify a custom <xref:System.ServiceModel.Security.IdentityVerifier> on the client's <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.SslStreamSecurityBindingElement>.  \\n  \\n```  \\n  \\nusing System;  \\nusing System.Collections.Generic;  \\nusing System.Linq;  \\nusing System.Net;  \\nusing System.IdentityModel.Claims;  \\nusing System.IdentityModel.Policy;  \\nusing System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;  \\nusing System.ServiceModel;  \\nusing System.ServiceModel.Channels;  \\nusing System.ServiceModel.Description;  \\nusing System.ServiceModel.Security;  \\nusing System.Xml;  \\n  \\nnamespace ServiceNamespace  \\n{  \\n    [ServiceContract]  \\n    interface IService  \\n    {  \\n        [OperationContract]  \\n        void DoSomething();  \\n    }  \\n  \\n    class DnsIdentityVerifier : IdentityVerifier  \\n    {  \\n        DnsEndpointIdentity _expectedIdentity;  \\n  \\n        public DnsIdentityVerifier(EndpointAddress serviceEndpoint)  \\n        {  \\n            _expectedIdentity = new DnsEndpointIdentity(serviceEndpoint.Uri.DnsSafeHost);  \\n        }  \\n  \\n        public override bool CheckAccess(EndpointIdentity identity, AuthorizationContext authContext)  \\n        {  \\n            Claim dnsClaim = authContext.Claims().Single(claim => claim.ClaimType == ClaimTypes.Dns);  \\n            return String.Equals(_expectedIdentity.IdentityClaim.Resource, dnsClaim.Resource);  \\n        }  \\n  \\n        public override bool TryGetIdentity(EndpointAddress reference, out EndpointIdentity identity)  \\n        {  \\n            identity = _expectedIdentity;  \\n            return true;  \\n        }  \\n    }  \\n  \\n    static class LinqExtensionForClaims  \\n    {  \\n        public static IEnumerable<Claim> Claims(this AuthorizationContext authContext)  \\n        {  \\n            if (null != authContext.ClaimSets)  \\n            {  \\n                foreach (ClaimSet claimSet in authContext.ClaimSets)  \\n                {  \\n                    if (null != claimSet)  \\n                    {  \\n                        foreach (Claim claim in claimSet)  \\n                        {  \\n                            yield return claim;  \\n                        }  \\n                    }  \\n                }  \\n            }  \\n        }  \\n    }  \\n  \\n    class Service : IService  \\n    {  \\n        public void DoSomething()  \\n        {  \\n            Console.WriteLine(\\\"Service called.\\\");  \\n        }  \\n    }  \\n  \\n    class Program  \\n    {  \\n        static void Main(string[] args)  \\n        {  \\n            string hostname = Dns.GetHostEntry(String.Empty).HostName;  \\n            NetTcpBinding serviceBinding = new NetTcpBinding(SecurityMode.TransportWithMessageCredential);  \\n  \\n            ServiceHost serviceHost = new ServiceHost(typeof(Service), new Uri(String.Format(\\\"net.tcp://{0}:8080/Service\\\", hostname)));  \\n            serviceHost.Credentials.ServiceCertificate.SetCertificate(StoreLocation.LocalMachine, StoreName.My, X509FindType.FindByThumbprint, \\\"8a 42 1b eb cf 8a 14 b1 de 83 d9 a5 70 88 0a 62 f9 bf 69 06\\\");  \\n            ServiceEndpoint serviceEndpoint = serviceHost.AddServiceEndpoint(typeof(IService), serviceBinding, \\\"Endpoint\\\");  \\n            serviceHost.Open();  \\n  \\n            CustomBinding clientBinding = new CustomBinding(serviceBinding.CreateBindingElements());  \\n            SslStreamSecurityBindingElement sslStream = clientBinding.Elements.Find<SslStreamSecurityBindingElement>();  \\n            sslStream.IdentityVerifier = new DnsIdentityVerifier(serviceEndpoint.Address);  \\n  \\n            ChannelFactory<IService> channelFactory = new ChannelFactory<IService>(clientBinding, new EndpointAddress(serviceEndpoint.Address.Uri, UpnEndpointIdentity.CreateUpnIdentity(\\\"username@domain\\\")));  \\n            channelFactory.Credentials.Windows.AllowNtlm = false;  \\n            IService channel = channelFactory.CreateChannel();  \\n            channel.DoSomething();  \\n        }  \\n    }  \\n  \\n```\"\n  syntax:\n    content: 'public class SslStreamSecurityBindingElement : System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingElement, System.ServiceModel.Channels.ITransportTokenAssertionProvider, System.ServiceModel.Description.IPolicyExportExtension'\n  inheritance:\n  -
