It is like the first example in the [Starting a thread](#Starting) section, except that it sets the thread to execute in the background before starting it. As the output shows, the loop is interrupted before it executes for five seconds.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Threading.Thread#3](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/System.Threading.Thread/cs/BackgroundEx1.cs#3)]\n [!code-vb[System.Threading.Thread#3](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/System.Threading.Thread/vb/BackgroundEx1.vb#3)]  \n  \n<a name=\"Culture\"></a>   \n## Culture and threads  \n Each thread has a culture, represented by the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentCulture%2A> property, and a UI culture, represented by the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentUICulture%2A> property.  The current culture supports such culture-sensitive  operations as parsing and formatting, string comparison and sorting, and also controls the writing system and calendar used by a thread. The current UI culture provides for culture-sensitive retrieval of resources in resource files.  \n  \n When a new thread is instantiated, its culture and UI culture are defined by the current system culture and UI culture, and not by the culture and UI culture of the thread from which the new thread is created. This means, for example, that if the current system culture is English (United States) and the current culture of the primary application thread is French (France), the culture of a new thread created by calling the   <xref:System.Threading.Thread.%23ctor%28System.Threading.ParameterizedThreadStart%29> constructor from the primary thread is English (United States), and not French (France).

For more information, see the \"Culture and task-based asynchronous operations\" section of the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> class topic.  \n  \n You can do either of the following to ensure that all of the threads executing in an application share the same culture and UI culture:  \n  \n-   You can pass a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object that represents that culture to the <xref:System.Threading.ParameterizedThreadStart> delegate or the <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem%28System.Threading.WaitCallback%2CSystem.Object%29?displayProperty=fullName> method.  \n  \n-   For apps running on the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](~/includes/net-v45-md.md)] and later versions, you can define the culture and UI culture that is to be assigned to all threads created in an application domain by setting the value of the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentCulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentUICulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> properties. Note that this is a per-application domain setting.  \n  \n For more information and examples, see the \"Culture and threads\" section of the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> class topic.  \n  \n<a name=\"Properties\"></a>   \n## Getting information about and controlling threads  \n You can retrieve a number of property values that provide information about a thread. In some cases, you can also set these property values to control the operation of the thread. These thread properties include:  \n  \n-   A name. <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Name%2A> is a write-once property that you can use to identify a thread.  Its default value is `null`.  \n  \n-   A hash code, which you can retrieve by calling the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.GetHashCode%2A> method. The hash code can be used to uniquely identify a thread; for the lifetime of your thread, its hash code will not collide with the value from any other thread, regardless of the application domain from which you obtain the value.  \n  \n-   A thread ID. The value of the read-only <xref:System.Threading.Thread.ManagedThreadId%2A> property is assigned by the runtime and uniquely identifies a thread within its process.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  An operating-system [ThreadId](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms683233.aspx) has no fixed relationship to a managed thread, because an unmanaged host can control the relationship between managed and unmanaged threads. Specifically, a sophisticated host can use the [CLR Hosting API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms404385.aspx) to schedule many managed threads against the same operating system thread, or to move a managed thread between different operating system threads.  \n  \n-   The thread's current state. For the duration of its existence, a thread is always in one or more of the states defined by the <xref:System.Threading.ThreadState> property.  \n  \n-   A scheduling priority level, which is defined by the <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPriority> property. Although you can set this value to request a thread's priority, it is not guaranteed to be honored by the operating system.  \n  \n-   The read-only <xref:System.Threading.Thread.IsThreadPoolThread%2A> property, which indicates whether a thread is  a thread pool thread.  \n  \n-   The <xref:System.Threading.Thread.IsBackground%2A> property.

Along with this main foreground thread, a process can create one or more threads to execute a portion of the program code associated with the process. These threads can execute either in the foreground or in the background. In addition, you can use the <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPool> class to execute code on worker threads that are managed by the common language runtime.  \\n  \\n In this section  \\n  \\n [Starting a thread](#Starting)   \\n [Retrieving Thread objects](#Retrieving)   \\n [Foreground and background threads](#Foreground)   \\n [Culture and threads](#Culture)   \\n [Getting information about and controlling threads](#Properties)   \\n [Accessing the source code for the Thread class](#Source)  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"Starting\\\"></a>   \\n## Starting a thread  \\n You start a thread by supplying a delegate that represents the method the thread is to execute in its class constructor. You then call the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Start%2A> method to begin execution.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Threading.Thread> constructors can take either of two delegate types, depending on whether you can pass an argument to the method to be executed:  \\n  \\n-   If the method has no arguments, you pass a <xref:System.Threading.ThreadStart> delegate to  the constructor. It has the signature:  \\n  \\n    ```csharp  \\n    public delegate void ThreadStart()  \\n    ```  \\n  \\n    ```vb  \\n    Public Delegate Sub ThreadStart()  \\n    ```  \\n  \\n     The following example creates and starts a thread that executes the `ExecuteInForeground` method. The method displays  information about some thread properties, then executes a loop in which it pauses for half a second and displays the elapsed number of seconds. When the thread has executed for at least five seconds, the loop ends and the thread terminates execution.  \\n  \\n     [!code-csharp[System.Threading.Thread#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/System.Threading.Thread/cs/ThreadStart1.cs#1)]\\n     [!code-vb[System.Threading.Thread#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/System.Threading.Thread/vb/ThreadStart1.vb#1)]  \\n  \\n-   If the method has an argument, you pass a <xref:System.Threading.ParameterizedThreadStart> delegate to the constructor. It has the signature:  \\n  \\n    ```csharp  \\n    public delegate void ParameterizedThreadStart(object obj)  \\n    ```  \\n  \\n    ```vb  \\n    Public Delegate Sub ParameterizedThreadStart(obj As Object)  \\n    ```  \\n  \\n     The method executed by the delegate can then cast (in C#) or convert (in Visual Basic) the parameter to the appropriate type.  \\n  \\n     The following example is identical to the previous one, except that it calls the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.%23ctor%28System.Threading.ParameterizedThreadStart%29> constructor. This version of the `ExecuteInForeground` method has a single parameter that represents the approximate number of milliseconds the loop is to execute.  \\n  \\n     [!code-csharp[System.Threading.Thread#2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/System.Threading.Thread/cs/ThreadStart2.cs#2)]\\n     [!code-vb[System.Threading.Thread#2](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/System.Threading.Thread/vb/ThreadStart2.vb#2)]  \\n  \\n It is not necessary to retain a reference to a <xref:System.Threading.Thread> object once you have started the thread.

The following example uses the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread%2A> property to display information about the main application thread, another foreground thread, a background thread, and a thread pool thread.  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[System.Threading.Thread#4](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/System.Threading.Thread/cs/Instance1.cs#4)]\\n [!code-vb[System.Threading.Thread#4](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/System.Threading.Thread/vb/Instance1.vb#4)]  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"Foreground\\\"></a>   \\n## Foreground and background threads  \\n Instances of the <xref:System.Threading.Thread> class represent either foreground threads or background threads. Background threads are identical to foreground threads with one exception: a background thread does not keep a process running if all foreground threads have terminated. Once all foreground threads have been stopped, the runtime stops all background threads and shuts down.  \\n  \\n By default, the following threads execute in the foreground:  \\n  \\n-   The main application thread.  \\n  \\n-   All threads created by calling a <xref:System.Threading.Thread> class constructor.  \\n  \\n The following threads execute in the background by default:  \\n  \\n-   Thread pool threads, which are a pool of worker threads maintained by the runtime.  You can configure the thread pool and schedule work on thread pool threads by using the <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPool> class.  \\n  \\n    > [!NOTE]\\n    >  Task-based asynchronous operations automatically execute on thread pool threads. Task-based asynchronous operations use the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task> and <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task%601> classes to implement the [task-based asynchronous pattern](~/docs/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/task-based-asynchronous-pattern-tap.md).  \\n  \\n-   All threads that enter the managed execution environment from unmanaged code.  \\n  \\n You can change a thread to execute in the background by setting the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.IsBackground%2A> property at any time.  Background threads are useful for any operation that should continue as long as an application is running but should not prevent the application from terminating, such as monitoring file system changes or incoming socket connections.  \\n  \\n The following example illustrates the difference between foreground and background threads. It is like the first example in the [Starting a thread](#Starting) section, except that it sets the thread to execute in the background before starting it. As the output shows, the loop is interrupted before it executes for five seconds.  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[System.Threading.Thread#3](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/System.Threading.Thread/cs/BackgroundEx1.cs#3)]\\n [!code-vb[System.Threading.Thread#3](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/System.Threading.Thread/vb/BackgroundEx1.vb#3)]  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"Culture\\\"></a>   \\n## Culture and threads  \\n Each thread has a culture, represented by the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentCulture%2A> property, and a UI culture, represented by the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentUICulture%2A> property.  The current culture supports such culture-sensitive  operations as parsing and formatting, string comparison and sorting, and also controls the writing system and calendar used by a thread. The current UI culture provides for culture-sensitive retrieval of resources in resource files.  \\n  \\n When a new thread is instantiated, its culture and UI culture are defined by the current system culture and UI culture, and not by the culture and UI culture of the thread from which the new thread is created. This means, for example, that if the current system culture is English (United States) and the current culture of the primary application thread is French (France), the culture of a new thread created by calling the   <xref:System.Threading.Thread.%23ctor%28System.Threading.ParameterizedThreadStart%29> constructor from the primary thread is English (United States), and not French (France). For more information, see the \\\"Culture and threads\\\" section of the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> class topic.  \\n  \\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\n>  This is not true of threads that execute asynchronous operations for apps that target the [!INCLUDE[net_v46](~/includes/net-v46-md.md)] and later versions, In this case, the culture and UI culture is part of an asynchronous operations' context; the thread on which an asynchronous operation executes by default inherits the culture and UI culture of the thread from which the asynchronous operation was launched. For more information, see the \\\"Culture and task-based asynchronous operations\\\" section of the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> class topic.  \\n  \\n You can do either of the following to ensure that all of the threads executing in an application share the same culture and UI culture:  \\n  \\n-   You can pass a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object that represents that culture to the <xref:System.Threading.ParameterizedThreadStart> delegate or the <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem%28System.Threading.WaitCallback%2CSystem.Object%29?displayProperty=fullName> method.  \\n  \\n-   For apps running on the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](~/includes/net-v45-md.md)] and later versions, you can define the culture and UI culture that is to be assigned to all threads created in an application domain by setting the value of the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentCulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentUICulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> properties. Note that this is a per-application domain setting.  \\n  \\n For more information and examples, see the \\\"Culture and threads\\\" section of the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> class topic.  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"Properties\\\"></a>   \\n## Getting information about and controlling threads  \\n You can retrieve a number of property values that provide information about a thread. In some cases, you can also set these property values to control the operation of the thread. These thread properties include:  \\n  \\n-   A name. <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Name%2A> is a write-once property that you can use to identify a thread.  Its default value is `null`.  \\n  \\n-   A hash code, which you can retrieve by calling the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.GetHashCode%2A> method. The hash code can be used to uniquely identify a thread; for the lifetime of your thread, its hash code will not collide with the value from any other thread, regardless of the application domain from which you obtain the value.  \\n  \\n-   A thread ID. The value of the read-only <xref:System.Threading.Thread.ManagedThreadId%2A> property is assigned by the runtime and uniquely identifies a thread within its process.  \\n  \\n    > [!NOTE]\\n    >  An operating-system [ThreadId](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms683233.aspx) has no fixed relationship to a managed thread, because an unmanaged host can control the relationship between managed and unmanaged threads. Specifically, a sophisticated host can use the [CLR Hosting API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms404385.aspx) to schedule many managed threads against the same operating system thread, or to move a managed thread between different operating system threads.  \\n  \\n-   The thread's current state. For the duration of its existence, a thread is always in one or more of the states defined by the <xref:System.Threading.ThreadState> property.  \\n  \\n-   A scheduling priority level, which is defined by the <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPriority> property. Although you can set this value to request a thread's priority, it is not guaranteed to be honored by the operating system.  \\n  \\n-   The read-only <xref:System.Threading.Thread.IsThreadPoolThread%2A> property, which indicates whether a thread is  a thread pool thread.  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.Threading.Thread.IsBackground%2A> property. For more information, see the [Foreground and background threads](#Foreground) section.  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"Source\\\"></a>   \\n## Accessing the source code for the Thread class  \\n To view the .NET Framework source code for the <xref:System.Threading.Thread> class, see the [Reference Source](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/threading/thread.cs#3980e012bae82e96).

If a larger value is specified for `maxStackSize` when code is running with partial trust, `maxStackSize` is ignored and the default stack size is used. No exception is thrown. Code at any trust level can set `maxStackSize` to a value that is less than the default stack size.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  If you are developing a fully trusted library that will be used by partially trusted code, and you need to start a thread that requires a large stack, you must assert full trust before creating the thread, or the default stack size will be used. Do not do this unless you fully control the code that runs on the thread.  \\n  \\n If `maxStackSize` is less than the minimum stack size, the minimum stack size is used. If `maxStackSize` is not a multiple of the page size, it is rounded to the next larger multiple of the page size. For example, if you are using the .NET Framework version 2.0 on Windows Vista, 256KB (262,144 bytes) is the minimum stack size, and the page size is 64KB (65,536 bytes).  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  On versions of Microsoft Windows prior to Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, `maxStackSize` is ignored, and the stack size specified in the executable header is used.  \\n  \\n If you specify a very small stack size, you might need to disable stack-overflow probing.

Subsequent calls to `GetNamedDataSlot` by any thread will return the new slot. However, any thread that still has a <xref:System.LocalDataStoreSlot?displayProperty=fullName> returned by an earlier call to `GetNamedDataSlot` can continue to use the old slot.  \\n  \\n A slot that has been associated with a name is released only when every `LocalDataStoreSlot` that was obtained prior to the call to `FreeNamedDataSlot` has been released and garbage-collected.  \\n  \\n Threads use a local store memory mechanism to store thread-specific data. The common language runtime allocates a multi-slot data store array to each process when it is created.

For better performance, use fields that are marked with the <xref href=\"System.ThreadStaticAttribute\"></xref> attribute instead.\n  remarks: \"> [!IMPORTANT]\\n>  The .NET Framework provides two mechanisms for using thread local storage (TLS): thread-relative static fields (that is, fields that are marked with the <xref:System.ThreadStaticAttribute> attribute) and data slots. Thread-relative static fields provide much better performance than data slots, and enable compile-time type checking. For more information about using TLS, see [Thread Local Storage: Thread-Relative Static Fields and Data Slots](~/docs/standard/threading/thread-local-storage-thread-relative-static-fields-and-data-slots.md).  \\n  \\n Threads use a local store memory mechanism to store thread-specific data. The common language runtime allocates a multi-slot data store array to each process when it is created. The thread can allocate a data slot in the data store, store and retrieve a data value in the slot, and free the slot for reuse after the thread expires. Data slots are unique per thread. No other thread (not even a child thread) can get that data.  \\n  \\n If the named slot does not exist, a new slot is allocated. Named data slots are public and can be manipulated by anyone.\"\n  example:\n  - \"This section contains two code examples. The first example shows how to use a field that is marked with the <xref:System.ThreadStaticAttribute> attribute to hold thread-specific information.

Thread-relative static fields provide much better performance than data slots, and enable compile-time type checking. For more information about using TLS, see [Thread Local Storage: Thread-Relative Static Fields and Data Slots](~/docs/standard/threading/thread-local-storage-thread-relative-static-fields-and-data-slots.md).  \\n  \\n Threads use a local store memory mechanism to store thread-specific data. The common language runtime allocates a multi-slot data store array to each process when it is created. The thread can allocate a data slot in the data store, store and retrieve a data value in the slot, and free the slot for reuse after the thread procedure ends and the <xref:System.Threading.Thread> object has been reclaimed by garbage collection. Data slots are unique per thread. No other thread (not even a child thread) can get that data.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  <xref:System.Threading.Thread.SetData%2A> is a `Shared` method that always applies to the currently executing thread, even if you call it using a variable that refers to another thread.
