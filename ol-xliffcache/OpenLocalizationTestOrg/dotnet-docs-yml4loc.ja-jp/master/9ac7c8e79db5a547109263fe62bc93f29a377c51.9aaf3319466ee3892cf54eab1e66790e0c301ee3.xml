Which of the two elements involved in the event is of the most importance in any given handler (<xref:System.Windows.RoutedEventArgs.Source%2A>, the element that raised it, or `sender`, the element that is currently handling it) is dependent on the application logic that your handler is addressing.  \\n  \\n Setting this property is typically only done when overriding or implementing other [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_api#plural](~/includes/tlasharptla-apisharpplural-md.md)] that adjust event sources, such as when class handling an event.
