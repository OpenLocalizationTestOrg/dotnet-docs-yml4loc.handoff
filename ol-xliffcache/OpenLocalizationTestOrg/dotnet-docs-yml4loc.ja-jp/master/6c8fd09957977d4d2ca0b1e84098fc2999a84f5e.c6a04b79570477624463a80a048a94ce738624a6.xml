This mode is similar to `CFB`; the only difference between the two modes is the way that the shift register is filled. If a bit in the cipher text is mangled, the corresponding bit of plain text will be mangled. However, if there are extra or missing bits from the cipher text, the plain text will be mangled from that point on.\n  syntax:\n    content: OFB\n    return:\n      type: System.Security.Cryptography.CipherMode\n      description: ''\n  exceptions: []\n  version:\n  - netcore-2.0\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  - netstandard-2.0\n  - xamarinandroid-7.1\n  - xamarinios-10.8\n  - xamarinmac-3.0\n  monikers:\n  - netcore-2.0\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  - netstandard-2.0\n  - xamarinandroid-7.1\n  - xamarinios-10.8\n  - xamarinmac-3.0\n  content_git_url: https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/xml/System.Security.Cryptography/CipherMode.xml\nreferences:\n- uid: System.Enum\n  parent: System\n  isExternal: false\n  name: Enum\n  nameWithType: Enum\n  fullName: System.Enum\n- uid: System.Security.Cryptography.CipherMode.CBC\n  parent: System.Security.Cryptography.CipherMode\n  isExternal: false\n  name: CBC\n  nameWithType: CipherMode.CBC\n  fullName: CipherMode.CBC\n- uid: System.Security.Cryptography.CipherMode\n  parent: System.Security.Cryptography\n  isExternal: false\n  name: CipherMode\n  nameWithType: CipherMode\n  fullName: System.Security.Cryptography.CipherMode\n- uid: System.Security.Cryptography.CipherMode.CFB\n  parent: System.Security.Cryptography.CipherMode\n  isExternal: false\n  name: CFB\n  nameWithType: CipherMode.CFB\n  fullName: CipherMode.CFB\n- uid: System.Security.Cryptography.CipherMode.CTS\n  parent: System.Security.Cryptography.CipherMode\n  isExternal: false\n  name: CTS\n  nameWithType: CipherMode.CTS\n  fullName: CipherMode.CTS\n- uid: System.Security.Cryptography.CipherMode.ECB\n  parent: System.Security.Cryptography.CipherMode\n  isExternal: false\n  name: ECB\n  nameWithType: CipherMode.ECB\n  fullName: CipherMode.ECB\n- uid: System.Security.Cryptography.CipherMode.OFB\n  parent: System.Security.Cryptography.CipherMode\n  isExternal: false\n  name: OFB\n  nameWithType: CipherMode.OFB\n  fullName: CipherMode.OFB\n"}
