Typically, your custom type editor interacts with the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PropertyGrid> control.  \\n  \\n Custom type editors are useful in situations where a text-box value editor is insufficient to effectively select the values of certain types.  \\n  \\n To implement a custom design-time UI type editor, you must perform the following steps:  \\n  \\n-   Define a class that derives from <xref:System.Drawing.Design.UITypeEditor>.  \\n  \\n-   Override the <xref:System.Drawing.Design.UITypeEditor.EditValue%2A> method to handle the user interface, user input processing, and value assignment.  \\n  \\n-   Override the <xref:System.Drawing.Design.UITypeEditor.GetEditStyle%2A> method to inform the Properties window of the type of editor style that the editor will use.  \\n  \\n You can add additional support for painting a value's representation in the Properties window by performing the following steps:  \\n  \\n-   Override the <xref:System.Drawing.Design.UITypeEditor.GetPaintValueSupported%2A> method to indicate that the editor supports displaying the value's representation.  \\n  \\n-   Override the <xref:System.Drawing.Design.UITypeEditor.PaintValue%2A> method to implement the display of the value's representation.  \\n  \\n-   Override the <xref:System.Drawing.Design.UITypeEditor> constructor method if the editor should have initialization behavior.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  The <xref:System.Drawing.Design.UITypeEditor> class does not support right-to-left (RTL) layouts.  \\n  \\n For more information about enhancing design-time support, see [Extending Design-Time Support](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/d6ac8a6a-42fd-4bc8-bf33-b212811297e2).
