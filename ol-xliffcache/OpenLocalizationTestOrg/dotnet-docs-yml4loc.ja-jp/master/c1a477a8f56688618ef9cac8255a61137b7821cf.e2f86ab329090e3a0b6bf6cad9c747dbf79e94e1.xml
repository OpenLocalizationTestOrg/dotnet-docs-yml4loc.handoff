Therefore, you should make any calls from your event handlers thread-safe.

Be sure to verify that your application works as expected on [!INCLUDE[windowsver](~/includes/windowsver-md.md)].\"\n  example:\n  - \"This section contains two examples. The first example shows how to use system events in an ordinary application, and the second example shows how to use system events in a Windows service.  \\n  \\n **Example 1**  \\n  \\n The following code example registers interest in some system events and then waits for any of those events to occur. The output shown occurs if the user changes the display resolution.  \\n  \\n [!code-cpp[SystemEvents#1](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/SystemEvents/cpp/SystemEvents.cpp#1)]\\n [!code-csharp[SystemEvents#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/SystemEvents/CS/SystemEvents.cs#1)]\\n [!code-vb[SystemEvents#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/SystemEvents/VB/SystemEvents.vb#1)]  \\n  \\n **Example 2**  \\n  \\n The following code example demonstrates a very simple Windows service that handles the <xref:Microsoft.Win32.SystemEvents.TimeChanged> and <xref:Microsoft.Win32.SystemEvents.UserPreferenceChanged> events. The example includes a service named `SimpleService`, a form named `HiddenForm`, and an installer. The form provides the message loop that is required by system events.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  Services do not have message loops, unless they are allowed to interact with the desktop. If the message loop is not provided by a hidden form, as in this example, the service must be run under the local system account, and manual intervention is required to enable interaction with the desktop. That is, the administrator must manually check the **Allow service to interact with desktop** check box on the **Log On** tab of the service properties dialog box. In that case, a message loop is automatically provided. This option is available only when the service is run under the local system account. Interaction with the desktop cannot be enabled programmatically.  \\n  \\n The service in this example starts a thread that runs an instance of `HiddenForm`. The events are hooked up and handled in the form. The events must be hooked up in the load event of the form, to make sure that the form is completely loaded first; otherwise the events will not be raised.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  The example provides all the necessary code, including the form initialization code typically generated by [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](~/includes/vsprvs-md.md)] designers. If you are developing your service in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](~/includes/vsprvs-md.md)], you can omit the second partial class and use the **Properties** window to set the height and width of the hidden form to zero, the border style to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FormBorderStyle?displayProperty=fullName>, and the window state to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FormWindowState?displayProperty=fullName>.  \\n  \\n To run the example:  \\n  \\n1.  Compile the code from the command line. The name that you use for the source file is not important.  \\n  \\n2.  Install the service from the command line using the [Installutil.exe (Installer Tool)](~/docs/framework/tools/installutil-exe-installer-tool.md) utility. For example, `InstallUtil example.exe` if the source file name is `example.cs` or `example.vb`. You must be an administrator to install the service.  \\n  \\n3.  Use the Services console to start the service.  \\n  \\n4.  Change the system time, or change user preferences, such as mouse properties.  \\n  \\n5.  View the messages in the **Application** category of Event Viewer.  \\n  \\n6.  Use the Services console to stop the service.  \\n  \\n7.  Uninstall the service from the command line by using the `/u` option. For example, `InstallUtil /u example.exe`.  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[ManagedWindowsService#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/ManagedWindowsService/cs/source.cs#1)]\\n [!code-vb[ManagedWindowsService#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/ManagedWindowsService/VB/source.vb#1)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public sealed class SystemEvents\n  inheritance:\n  - System.Object\n  implements: []\n  inheritedMembers:\n  - System.Object.Equals(System.Object)\n  - System.Object.Equals(System.Object,System.Object)\n  - System.Object.GetHashCode\n  - System.Object.GetType\n  - System.Object.MemberwiseClone\n  - System.Object.ReferenceEquals(System.Object,System.Object)\n  - System.Object.ToString\n  version:\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  - xamarinmac-3.0\n  monikers:\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  - xamarinmac-3.0\n  content_git_url: https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/xml/Microsoft.Win32/SystemEvents.xml\n  ms.technology:\n  - dotnet-standard\n  author: stevehoag\n  ms.author: shoag\n  manager: wpickett\n- uid: Microsoft.Win32.SystemEvents.CreateTimer(System.Int32)\n  commentId: M:Microsoft.Win32.SystemEvents.CreateTimer(System.Int32)\n  id: CreateTimer(System.Int32)\n  parent: Microsoft.Win32.SystemEvents\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: CreateTimer(Int32)\n  nameWithType: SystemEvents.CreateTimer(Int32)\n  fullName: SystemEvents.CreateTimer(Int32)\n  type: Method\n  assemblies:\n  - System\n  namespace: Microsoft.Win32\n  summary: Creates a new window timer associated with the system events window.\n  syntax:\n    content: public static IntPtr CreateTimer (int interval);\n    parameters:\n    - id: interval\n      type: System.Int32\n      description: Specifies the interval between timer notifications, in milliseconds.\n    return:\n      type: System.IntPtr\n      description: The ID of the new timer.\n  overload: Microsoft.Win32.SystemEvents.CreateTimer*\n  exceptions:\n  - type: System.ArgumentException\n    commentId: T:System.ArgumentException\n    description: The interval is less than or equal to zero.\n  - type: System.InvalidOperationException\n    commentId: T:System.InvalidOperationException\n    description: System event notifications are not supported under the current context.
