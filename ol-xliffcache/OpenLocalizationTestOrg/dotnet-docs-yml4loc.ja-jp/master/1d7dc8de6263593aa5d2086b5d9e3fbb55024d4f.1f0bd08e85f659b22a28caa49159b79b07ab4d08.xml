If a property is set by a default style, the property might change from its default value when the control appears in the application. The default style is determined by which desktop theme is used when the application is running.

For more information, see [Hosting Process (vshost.exe)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/c6b9e2be-f18d-4d75-ac52-56d55784734b).  \\n  \\n-   One icon per window that is specified by setting <xref:System.Windows.Window.Icon%2A>. For each window, this icon is used in its title bar, its task bar button, and in its ALT-TAB application selection list entry.  \\n  \\n A [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](~/includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] window always displays an icon. When one is not provided by setting <xref:System.Windows.Window.Icon%2A>, [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](~/includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] chooses an icon to display based on the following rules:  \\n  \\n1.  Use the assembly icon, if specified.  \\n  \\n2.  If the assembly icon is not specified, use the default [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_win](~/includes/tlasharptla-win-md.md)] icon.  \\n  \\n If you use <xref:System.Windows.Window.Icon%2A> to specify a custom window icon, you can restore the default application icon by setting <xref:System.Windows.Window.Icon%2A> to `null`.  \\n  \\n A single icon can be used in a variety of ways in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)], including being shown in the title bar of a window, the task bar for a window, the ALT+TAB file selection list. Each of these shows the icon using a different size; a 16x16 pixel icon is displayed in the title bar of a window and in the task bar, while a 32x32 pixel icon is displayed in the ALT+TAB file selection list. Some applications, like [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winexpl](~/includes/tlasharptla-winexpl-md.md)], provide a **View** menu that allows you to choose the size of the icon you'd like to view.  \\n  \\n To cater to the various display sizes, an icon file is composed of one or more actual icons where each one represents a version of the icon that targets a specific size and color depth. For example, one icon may only have a single 16x16 pixel icon with 16 colors, while another may contain 16x16 pixel and 32x32 pixel icons with both 16 colors and 256 colors.  \\n  \\n If icons for all possible sizes and color depths exist within an icon file, <xref:System.Windows.Window> will use the appropriate icon. If an icon file contains only a subset of all the possible icons, <xref:System.Windows.Window> uses the next most appropriate icon in order of decreasing sizes and color depth.  \\n  \\n The result is that an icon will always be used by <xref:System.Windows.Window>, although the icon used may not target the required size and color depth. For example, a 16x16 pixel icon with 16 colors may be used for display as a 32x32 pixel icon with 256 colors. This can cause undesirable visual effects, such as pixilation, but may be avoided by creating icons for all targeted sizes and color depths.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  You cannot set or get this property when a window is hosted in a browser.  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"dependencyPropertyInfo_WindowIcon\\\"></a>   \\n## Dependency Property Information  \\n  \\n|||  \\n|-|-|  \\n|Identifier field|<xref:System.Windows.Window.IconProperty>|  \\n|Metadata properties set to `true`|None|\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following example shows how to set a window icon.  \\n  \\n [!code-xml[WindowIconSnippets#WindowIconSetXAML](~/samples/snippets/xaml/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WindowIconSnippets/XAML/MainWindow.xaml#windowiconsetxaml)]  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[WindowIconSnippets#SetWindowIconInCode](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WindowIconSnippets/CSharp/MainWindow.xaml.cs#setwindowiconincode)]\\n [!code-vb[WindowIconSnippets#SetWindowIconInCode](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WindowIconSnippets/visualbasic/mainwindow.xaml.vb#setwindowiconincode)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: >-\n      [set: System.Security.SecurityCritical]\n\n      public System.Windows.Media.ImageSource Icon { get; set; }\n    return:\n      type: System.Windows.Media.ImageSource\n      description: An <xref href=\"System.Windows.Media.ImageSource\"></xref> object that represents the icon.\n  overload: System.Windows.Window.Icon*\n  exceptions: []\n  attributes:\n  - type: 'set: System.Security.SecurityCritical'\n  version:\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  monikers:\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  content_git_url: https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/xml/System.Windows/Window.xml\n  ms.technology:\n  - dotnet-wpf\n  author: stevehoag\n  ms.author: shoag\n  manager: wpickett\n- uid: System.Windows.Window.IconProperty\n  commentId: F:System.Windows.Window.IconProperty\n  id: IconProperty\n  parent: System.Windows.Window\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: IconProperty\n  nameWithType: Window.IconProperty\n  fullName: Window.IconProperty\n  type: Field\n  assemblies:\n  - PresentationFramework\n  namespace: System.Windows\n  summary: Identifies the <xref href=\"System.Windows.Window.Icon\"></xref> dependency property.\n  syntax:\n    content: public static readonly System.Windows.DependencyProperty IconProperty;\n    return:\n      type: System.Windows.DependencyProperty\n      description: ''\n  exceptions: []\n  version:\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  monikers:\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  content_git_url: https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/xml/System.Windows/Window.xml\n  ms.technology:\n  - dotnet-wpf\n  author: stevehoag\n  ms.author: shoag\n  manager: wpickett\n- uid: System.Windows.Window.IsActive\n  commentId: P:System.Windows.Window.IsActive\n  id: IsActive\n  parent: System.Windows.Window\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: IsActive\n  nameWithType: Window.IsActive\n  fullName: Window.IsActive\n  type: Property\n  assemblies:\n  - PresentationFramework\n  namespace: System.Windows\n  summary: Gets a value that indicates whether the window is active.\n  remarks: \"An active window is the user's current foreground window and has the focus, which is signified by the active appearance of the title bar.

This relationship enforces certain behaviors, including with respect to minimizing, maximizing, and restoring.  \\n  \\n When a child window is created by a parent window by calling <xref:System.Windows.Window.Show%2A>, however, the child window does not have a relationship with the parent window. This means that:  \\n  \\n-   The child window does not have a reference to the parent window.  \\n  \\n-   The behavior of the child window is not dependent on the behavior of the parent window; either window can cover the other, or be minimized, maximized, and restored independently of the other.  \\n  \\n To allow you to create a relationship between a child window and a parent window, <xref:System.Windows.Window> supports the notion of ownership. Ownership is established when the <xref:System.Windows.Window.Owner%2A> property of a window (the owned window) is set with a reference to another window (the owner window).  \\n  \\n Once this relationship is established, the following behaviors are exhibited:  \\n  \\n-   If an owner window is minimized, all its owned windows are minimized as well.  \\n  \\n-   If an owned window is minimized, its owner is not minimized.  \\n  \\n-   If an owner window is maximized, both the owner window and its owned windows are restored.  \\n  \\n-   An owner window can never cover an owned window.  \\n  \\n-   Owned windows that were not opened using <xref:System.Windows.Window.ShowDialog%2A> are not modal. The user can still interact with the owner window.  \\n  \\n-   If you close an owner window, its owned windows are also closed.  \\n  \\n-   If an owned window was opened by its owner window using <xref:System.Windows.Window.Show%2A>, and the owner window is closed, the owned window's <xref:System.Windows.Window.Closing> event is not raised.  \\n  \\n When you open a child window by calling <xref:System.Windows.Window.ShowDialog%2A>, you should also set the <xref:System.Windows.Window.Owner%2A> property of the child window. If you don't, then your users won't be able to restore both child window and parent window by pressing the task bar button.
