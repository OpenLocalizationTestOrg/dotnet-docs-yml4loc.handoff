System.Web\n  namespace: System.Web\n  summary: Provides a common base class for all site map data providers, and a way for developers to implement custom site map data providers that can be used with the ASP.NET site map infrastructure as persistent stores for <xref href=\"System.Web.SiteMap\"></xref> objects.\n  remarks: \"The <xref:System.Web.StaticSiteMapProvider> and <xref:System.Web.XmlSiteMapProvider> classes represent the default implementations of the abstract <xref:System.Web.SiteMapProvider> class. The <xref:System.Web.XmlSiteMapProvider> uses an XML file named Web.sitemap to store site map data. For more information on about the Web.sitemap file, see [ASP.NET Site Maps](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/6b85a558-1df8-44cf-bea6-62e61bcc8d20).  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Web.SiteMapProvider> class supports the concept of a site map provider hierarchy, by declaring the <xref:System.Web.SiteMapProvider.RootProvider%2A> and <xref:System.Web.SiteMapProvider.ParentProvider%2A> properties. A <xref:System.Web.SiteMapProvider> can be a child or parent of another provider. This enables scenarios where different content areas of a site are owned or implemented by different development groups that maintain their own site maps and site map providers.  \\n  \\n All <xref:System.Web.SiteMapProvider> objects are configured in the Web.config files. Any site map providers that are declared in these configuration files are loaded at run time and are used to load and process site navigation data. The <xref:System.Web.SiteMap> object, which keeps track of all the providers that are available to it through its <xref:System.Web.SiteMap.Providers%2A> property collection, provides programmatic access to the navigation data that is managed by the providers. The following code example demonstrates the format that is used to declare a site map provider in a Web.config file.  \\n  \\n```  \\n<siteMap defaultProvider=\\\"<name>\\\">  \\n  <providers>  \\n    <add  \\n      name=\\\"<friendly name>\\\"  \\n      type=\\\"<fully qualified class name>, <assembly name (optional)>\\\"   \\n      siteMapFile = \\\"<file name>\\\" />  \\n  </providers>  \\n</siteMap>  \\n```  \\n  \\n The site navigation data that is loaded by these providers is used by other components of the site map infrastructure, such as the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.TreeView> controls, to display site map information for users.  \\n  \\n If you implement your own site map provider, you can place the source file in the App_Code directory of your ASP.NET application, and then the assembly will be compiled automatically. You can also place your own site map provider in the Global Assembly Cache (GAC), and provide a fully-qualified reference to it in the Web.config file. For more information on compiler services, see [Working with Assemblies and the Global Assembly Cache](~/docs/framework/app-domains/working-with-assemblies-and-the-gac.md).\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example demonstrates how to write a class that implements the abstract <xref:System.Web.SiteMapProvider> class. This example includes only a sample <xref:System.Web.SiteMapProvider> and a sample text file that works with it. To run the example you also need an entry in the Web.config file and an .aspx page. You can find these in the documentation for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapDataSource.SiteMapProvider%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property.  \\n  \\n The example uses a comma-delimited file that follows an expected structure to load sitemap information. The first line of the file represents the root node of the sitemap, and subsequent lines are subnodes. Each subnode identifies its parent node by URL. An example of a file that meets these criteria is shown below.  \\n  \\n```  \\ndefault.aspx,Home,MyCompany Home Page,  \\nsale.aspx,Now On Sale,Check Out These Great Deals!,default.aspx  \\ncatalog.aspx,Online Catalog,Browse Our Many Great Items!,default.aspx  \\n```  \\n  \\n The `SimpleTextSiteMapProvider` provides example implementations of all the <xref:System.Web.SiteMapProvider> properties and methods.  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[Urtue.Samples.Alexkr.SimpleTextSiteMapProvider_1#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_WebNet/Urtue.Samples.Alexkr.SimpleTextSiteMapProvider_1/CS/simpletextsitemapprovider.cs#1)]\\n [!code-vb[Urtue.Samples.Alexkr.SimpleTextSiteMapProvider_1#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_WebNet/Urtue.Samples.Alexkr.SimpleTextSiteMapProvider_1/VB/simpletextsitemapprovider.vb#1)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: 'public abstract class SiteMapProvider : System.Configuration.Provider.ProviderBase'\n  inheritance:\n  - System.Object\n  - System.Configuration.Provider.ProviderBase\n  derivedClasses:\n  - System.Web.StaticSiteMapProvider\n  implements: []\n  inheritedMembers:\n  - System.Configuration.Provider.ProviderBase.Description\n  - System.Configuration.Provider.ProviderBase.Name\n  - System.Object.Equals(System.Object)\n  - System.Object.Equals(System.Object,System.Object)\n  - System.Object.GetHashCode\n  - System.Object.GetType\n  - System.Object.MemberwiseClone\n  - System.Object.ReferenceEquals(System.Object,System.Object)\n  - System.Object.ToString\n  version:\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  monikers:\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  content_git_url: https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/xml/System.Web/SiteMapProvider.xml\n  ms.technology:\n  - dotnet-webforms\n  ms.author: riande\n  manager: wpickett\n- uid: System.Web.SiteMapProvider.#ctor\n  commentId: M:System.Web.SiteMapProvider.#ctor\n  id: '#ctor'\n  parent: System.Web.SiteMapProvider\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: SiteMapProvider()\n  nameWithType: SiteMapProvider.SiteMapProvider()\n  fullName: SiteMapProvider.SiteMapProvider()\n  type: Constructor\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Web\n  namespace: System.Web\n  summary: Initializes a new instance of the <xref href=\"System.Web.SiteMapProvider\"></xref> class.\n  remarks: >-\n    > [!NOTE]\n\n    >  The <xref:System.Web.SiteMapProvider> class is not instantiated directly.
