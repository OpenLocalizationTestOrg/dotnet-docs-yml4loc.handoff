The <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.SEHException> class also corresponds to the `HRESULT` `E_FAIL` (0x80004005).  \\n  \\n The .NET Framework often encounters unmanaged SEH exceptions that are automatically mapped to managed equivalents. There are two common unmanaged SEH exceptions:  \\n  \\n-   `STATUS_NO_MEMORY` exceptions are automatically mapped to the <xref:System.OutOfMemoryException> class.  \\n  \\n-   `STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION` exceptions are automatically mapped as follows:  \\n  \\n    -   If `legacyNullReferencePolicy` is applied, all access violations are mapped to the <xref:System.NullReferenceException> class.  \\n  \\n    -   If the address at which the read/write was attempted is not in JIT-compiled code, the exception is mapped to the <xref:System.AccessViolationException> class.  \\n  \\n    -   If the address at which the read/write was attempted is in JIT-compiled code, but it is not in the OS Null partition area, the exception is mapped to the <xref:System.AccessViolationException> class.  \\n  \\n    -   If there is no `legacyNullReferencePolicy`, and the address at which the read/write was attempted is in JIT-compiled code and in the OS Null partition area, the exception is mapped to the <xref:System.NullReferenceException> class.  \\n  \\n Any SEH exception that is not automatically mapped to a specific exception is mapped to the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.SEHException> class by default.  \\n  \\n For more information, search on \\\"unmanaged exceptions\\\" and \\\"Structured Exception Handling\\\" in the MSDN Library.  \\n  \\n Note that the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.SEHException> class does not cause unmanaged C++ exception destructors to be called. To ensure that unmanaged C++ exception destructors are called, use the following syntax in the `catch` block.  \\n  \\n```vb  \\nCatch   \\n     ' Handle catch here.  \\nEnd Try  \\n```  \\n  \\n```csharp  \\ncatch  \\n{  \\n     // Handle catch here.  \\n}  \\n```  \\n  \\n```cpp  \\ncatch(…)  \\n{  \\n     // Handle catch here.  \\n}   \\n```\"\n  syntax:\n    content: >-\n      [System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComVisible(true)]\n\n      public class SEHException : System.Runtime.InteropServices.ExternalException\n  inheritance:\n  - System.Object\n  - System.Exception\n  implements: []\n  inheritedMembers:\n  - System.Exception.Data\n  - System.Exception.GetBaseException\n  - System.Exception.GetObjectData(System.Runtime.Serialization.SerializationInfo,System.Runtime.Serialization.StreamingContext)\n  - System.Exception.GetType\n  - System.Exception.HelpLink\n  - System.Exception.HResult\n  - System.Exception.InnerException\n  - System.Exception.Message\n  - System.Exception.SerializeObjectState\n  - System.Exception.Source\n  - System.Exception.StackTrace\n  - System.Exception.TargetSite\n  - System.Exception.ToString\n  - System.Object.Equals(System.Object)\n  - System.Object.Equals(System.Object,System.Object)\n  - System.Object.GetHashCode\n  - System.Object.MemberwiseClone\n  - System.Object.ReferenceEquals(System.Object,System.Object)\n  attributes:\n  - type: System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComVisibleAttribute\n  version:\n  - netcore-1.0\n  - netcore-1.1\n  - netcore-2.0\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  - netstandard-1.1\n  - netstandard-1.2\n  - netstandard-1.3\n  - netstandard-1.4\n  - netstandard-1.5\n  - netstandard-1.6\n  - netstandard-2.0\n  - xamarinandroid-7.1\n  - xamarinios-10.8\n  - xamarinmac-3.0\n  monikers:\n  - netcore-1.0\n  - netcore-1.1\n  - netcore-2.0\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  - netstandard-1.1\n  - netstandard-1.2\n  - netstandard-1.3\n  - netstandard-1.4\n  - netstandard-1.5\n  - netstandard-1.6\n  - netstandard-2.0\n  - xamarinandroid-7.1\n  - xamarinios-10.8\n  - xamarinmac-3.0\n  content_git_url: https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/xml/System.Runtime.InteropServices/SEHException.xml\n  ms.technology:\n  - dotnet-standard\n  author: rpetrusha\n  ms.author: ronpet\n  manager: wpickett\n- uid: System.Runtime.InteropServices.SEHException.#ctor\n  commentId: M:System.Runtime.InteropServices.SEHException.#ctor\n  id: '#ctor'\n  parent: System.Runtime.InteropServices.SEHException\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: SEHException()\n  nameWithType: SEHException.SEHException()\n  fullName: SEHException.SEHException()\n  type: Constructor\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Runtime.InteropServices\n  - mscorlib\n  - netstandard\n  namespace: System.Runtime.InteropServices\n  summary: Initializes a new instance of the <xref href=\"System.Runtime.InteropServices.SEHException\"></xref> class.\n  remarks: \"The <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.SEHException> class inherits from the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ExternalException> class.
