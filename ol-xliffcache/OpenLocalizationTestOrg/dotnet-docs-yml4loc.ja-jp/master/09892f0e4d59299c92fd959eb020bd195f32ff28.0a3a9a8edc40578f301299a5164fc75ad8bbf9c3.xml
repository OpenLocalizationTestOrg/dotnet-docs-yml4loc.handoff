To access a specific cell in the row, use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.TableRow.Cells%2A> property of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridViewRow> object contained in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridViewRowEventArgs.Row%2A> property. You can also determine which row type (header row, data row, and so on) is being created by using the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridViewRow.RowType%2A> property of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridViewRow> object.\n  example:\n  - \"The following example demonstrates how to use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridViewRowEventArgs.Row%2A> property to access the properties of the row being bound to data.  \\n  \\n <!-- TODO: review snippet reference [!code-csharp[GridViewRowDataBound#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_WebNet/GridViewRowDataBound/CS/gridviewrowdataboundcs.aspx#1)]  -->\\n <!-- TODO: review snippet reference [!code-vb[GridViewRowDataBound#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_WebNet/GridViewRowDataBound/VB/gridviewrowdataboundvb.aspx#1)]  -->\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridViewRow Row { get;
