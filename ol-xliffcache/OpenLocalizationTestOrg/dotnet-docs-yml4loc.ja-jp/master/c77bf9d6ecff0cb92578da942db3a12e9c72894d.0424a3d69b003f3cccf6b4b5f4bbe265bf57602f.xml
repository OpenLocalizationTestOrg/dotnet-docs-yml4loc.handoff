A drag-and-drop operation is analogous to a copy (or cut)-and-paste operation that is used to transfer data from one object or application to another. Drag-and-drop operations typically involve two parties: a drag source from which the dragged data originates and a drop target which receives the dropped data. The events and methods required for drag-and-drop operations are defined in the <xref:System.Windows.DragDrop> class. The drag-and-drop events are attached events that can be attached to any <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> or <xref:System.Windows.ContentElement>. The drag source and drop target may be UI elements in the same application or in different applications. However, the drop target must know how to process the data being passed by the drag source.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  The <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> and <xref:System.Windows.ContentElement> classes contain aliases for the drag-and-drop events so that the events appear in the class members list when these classes are inherited as a base class. When you attach an event handler to a drag-and-drop event on one of these classes, the handler is attached to the underlying <xref:System.Windows.DragDrop> event and they receive the same instance of event data. For example, see <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Drop?displayProperty=fullName>.  \\n  \\n The drag source initiates a drag-and-drop operation by calling the static <xref:System.Windows.DragDrop.DoDragDrop%2A> method and passing the transferred data to it. An element typically handles the following events when it is a drag source:  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.DragDrop.GiveFeedback>  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.DragDrop.QueryContinueDrag>  \\n  \\n An element typically handles the following events when it is a drop target:  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.DragDrop.DragEnter>  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.DragDrop.DragLeave>  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.DragDrop.DragOver>  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Windows.DragDrop.Drop>  \\n  \\n For more information and examples, see [Drag and Drop Overview](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/drag-and-drop-overview.md).\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public static class DragDrop\n  inheritance:\n  - System.Object\n  implements: []\n  inheritedMembers:\n  - System.Object.Equals(System.Object)\n  - System.Object.Equals(System.Object,System.Object)\n  - System.Object.GetHashCode\n  - System.Object.GetType\n  - System.Object.MemberwiseClone\n  - System.Object.ReferenceEquals(System.Object,System.Object)\n  - System.Object.ToString\n  version:\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  monikers:\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  content_git_url: https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/xml/System.Windows/DragDrop.xml\n  ms.technology:\n  - dotnet-wpf\n  author: stevehoag\n  ms.author: shoag\n  manager: wpickett\n- uid: System.Windows.DragDrop.AddDragEnterHandler(System.Windows.DependencyObject,System.Windows.DragEventHandler)\n  commentId: M:System.Windows.DragDrop.AddDragEnterHandler(System.Windows.DependencyObject,System.Windows.DragEventHandler)\n  id: AddDragEnterHandler(System.Windows.DependencyObject,System.Windows.DragEventHandler)\n  parent: System.Windows.DragDrop\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: AddDragEnterHandler(DependencyObject, DragEventHandler)\n  nameWithType: DragDrop.AddDragEnterHandler(DependencyObject, DragEventHandler)\n  fullName: DragDrop.AddDragEnterHandler(DependencyObject, DragEventHandler)\n  type: Method\n  assemblies:\n  - PresentationCore\n  namespace: System.Windows\n  summary: Adds a <xref href=\"System.Windows.DragDrop.DragEnter\"></xref> event handler to a specified dependency object.\n  remarks: \"The <xref:System.Windows.DragDrop.DragEnter> event occurs when an object is dragged into the element's bounds.  \\n  \\n This method adds a handler for the bubbling version of the <xref:System.Windows.DragDrop.DragEnter> event.
