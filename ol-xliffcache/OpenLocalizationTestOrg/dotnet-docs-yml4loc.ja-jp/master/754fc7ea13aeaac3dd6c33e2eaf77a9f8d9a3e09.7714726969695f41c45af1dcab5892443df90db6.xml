The second version contains extra data (`ID` field) that is not present in the first version. The code then deserializes the XML document into a `Person` object, then immediately reserializes the object including the extra data. Finally, the code deserializes the new XML into a `PersonVersion2` object and writes the complete data to the console, proving that the data has made a round trip to and from an older version of the type.
