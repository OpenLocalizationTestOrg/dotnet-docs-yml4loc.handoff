To play media in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] only, use a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.MediaElement>. Also, if you declare an instance in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)], the only practical use is to fill property element syntax for the <xref:System.Windows.Media.VideoDrawing.Player%2A> property.  \\n  \\n When distributing media with your application, you cannot use a media file as a project resource. In your project file, you must instead set the media type to `Content` and set `CopyToOutputDirectory` to `PreserveNewest` or `Always`.  \\n  \\n <xref:System.Windows.Media.MediaPlayer> can be used in two different modes, depending on what is driving the player: independent mode or clock mode. In independent mode, the <xref:System.Windows.Media.MediaPlayer> is analogous to an image and the media opened through the <xref:System.Windows.Media.MediaPlayer.Open%2A> method drives playback. In Clock mode, the <xref:System.Windows.Media.MediaPlayer> can be thought of as a target for an animation, and thus it will have corresponding <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Timeline> and <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Clock> entries in the Timing tree which controls playback.
