An issuer name registry is used to associate a mnemonic name to the cryptographic material that is needed to verify the signatures of tokens produced by the corresponding issuer. The issuer name registry maintains a list of issuers that are trusted by a relying party (RP) application.\n  remarks: \"The issuer name registry is used to associate a mnemonic name to the cryptographic material needed to verify signatures of tokens produced by the corresponding issuer.

The methods exposed by the <xref:System.IdentityModel.Tokens.IssuerNameRegistry> class are called from the pipeline by the security token handler that is processing the token. Tokens signed by material that is not mapped by an issuer name registry are discarded as untrusted. The name returned by the issuer name registry should be unique within the context of an RP application.  \\n  \\n In code, you can specify the issuer name registry to use by setting the <xref:System.IdentityModel.Tokens.SecurityTokenHandlerConfiguration.IssuerNameRegistry%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property. In a configuration file, the issuer name registry can be specified by specifying the [\\\\&lt;issuerNameRegistry\\\\&gt;](~/docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/windows-identity-foundation/issuernameregistry.md) element under the [\\\\&lt;securityTokenHandlerConfiguration\\\\&gt;](~/docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/windows-identity-foundation/securitytokenhandlerconfiguration.md) element.  \\n  \\n Windows Identity Foundation (WIF) provides an implementation of the <xref:System.IdentityModel.Tokens.IssuerNameRegistry> class out of the box: the <xref:System.IdentityModel.Tokens.ConfigurationBasedIssuerNameRegistry> class. When you use this implementation you can specify the list of trusted issuers in the configuration file of the RP application under the [\\\\&lt;trustedIssuers\\\\&gt;](~/docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/windows-identity-foundation/trustedissuers.md) element, which is a child element of the `<issuerNameRegistry>` element when the <xref:System.IdentityModel.Tokens.ConfigurationBasedIssuerNameRegistry>.class is referenced in that element’s `type` attribute. Under the `<trustedIssuers>` element, each issuer name is mapped to the X.509 certificate that should be used to verify its signature.  \\n  \\n To create a custom issuer name registry, you must override the <xref:System.IdentityModel.Tokens.IssuerNameRegistry.GetIssuerName%28System.IdentityModel.Tokens.SecurityToken%29?displayProperty=fullName> method. This method returns the issuer name for the specified security token. You can optionally override the <xref:System.IdentityModel.Tokens.IssuerNameRegistry.GetIssuerName%28System.IdentityModel.Tokens.SecurityToken%2CSystem.String%29?displayProperty=fullName> method to provide a hinting mechanism when retrieving issuer names and the <xref:System.IdentityModel.Tokens.IssuerNameRegistry.GetWindowsIssuerName%2A> method if you want to provide an issuer name for Windows tokens that is different from <xref:System.Security.Claims.ClaimsIdentity.DefaultIssuer>. Override the <xref:System.IdentityModel.Tokens.IssuerNameRegistry.LoadCustomConfiguration%2A> method to enable your issuer name registry to be initialized from a configuration file.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code shows an implementation of the <xref:System.IdentityModel.Tokens.IssuerNameRegistry> class that only accepts issuers that use certificates with subject \\\"CN=localhost\\\".  \\n  \\n> [!WARNING]\\n>  The following code is for illustrative purposes only.
