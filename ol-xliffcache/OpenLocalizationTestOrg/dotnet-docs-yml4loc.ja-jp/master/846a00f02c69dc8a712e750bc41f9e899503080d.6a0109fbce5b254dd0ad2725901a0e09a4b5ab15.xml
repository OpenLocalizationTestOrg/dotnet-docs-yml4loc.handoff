Jump Lists are also used in the [!INCLUDE[win7](~/includes/win7-md.md)] Start menu. You access a Jump List by right-clicking a taskbar button or by clicking the arrow next to a program in the Start menu. For more information about Jump Lists, see the [Taskbar](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=178478) section of the Windows User Experience Interaction Guidelines.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> class provides a managed wrapper for the Jump List functionality in the [!INCLUDE[win7](~/includes/win7-md.md)] taskbar and manages the data passed to the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] shell. The functionality exposed by the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> class is not available in versions of [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] earlier than [!INCLUDE[win7](~/includes/win7-md.md)]. Applications that use the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> class will run in other versions of [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)], but the Jump List will not be available. For more information about the Windows shell and native Jump List APIs, see [Taskbar Extensions](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=178479).  \n  \n The following illustration shows the Jump List for Windows Media Player, with items in the **Tasks** and **Frequent** categories.  \n  \n ![Windows Media Player Jump List](~/add/media/wpfshell-jumplist.png \"Windows Media Player Jump List\")  \nWindows Media Player Jump List  \n  \n## Configuring a Jump List  \n Jump Lists can contain two types of items, a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpTask> and a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpPath>. A <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpTask> is a link to a program and a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpPath> is a link to a file. You can visually separate items in a Jump List by creating a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpTask> that does not have a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpTask.Title%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpItem.CustomCategory%2A> specified. This empty <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpTask> will be displayed as a horizontal line in the Jump List.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  If the type of the file specified in a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpPath> is not registered with your application, the file will not appear in the Jump List. For example, if you add a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpPath> that points to a .txt file, your application must be registered to handle .txt files. For more information, see [Introduction to File Associations](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=178480).  \n  \n Jump items are placed into categories in the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList>. By default, a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpItem> is displayed in the **Tasks** category. Alternatively, you can specify a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpItem.CustomCategory%2A> for the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpItem>.  \n  \n You can specify whether the standard **Recent** and **Frequent** categories are displayed in the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList.ShowRecentCategory%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList.ShowFrequentCategory%2A> properties. The contents of these categories are managed by the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] shell. Because these categories might contain much of the same data, you typically display one or the other in your <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList>, but not both. [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] automatically manages recent items if they are opened through a common file dialog box or used to open an application through file type association. When an item is accessed through the Jump List, you can notify the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] shell to add the item to the **Recent** category by calling the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList.AddToRecentCategory%2A> method.  \n  \n## Applying a Jump List to the Windows Shell  \n You cannot access the shell’s Jump List directly or read its contents into the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> class. Instead, the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> class provides a representation of a Jump List that you can work with, and then apply to the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] shell. You typically create a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> and set it one time when the application is first run. However, you can modify or replace the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> at run time.  \n  \n When you have set the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> properties, you must apply the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> to the Windows shell before its contents appear in the taskbar Jump List. This is done automatically when the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> is first attached to an application, either in XAML or in a call to the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList.SetJumpList%2A> method. If you modify the contents of the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> at run time, you must call the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList.Apply%2A> method to apply its current contents to the Windows shell.  \n  \n## Setting a Jump List in XAML  \n A <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> is not automatically attached to an <xref:System.Windows.Application> object. You attach a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> to an <xref:System.Windows.Application> object in XAML by using the attached property syntax. The <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> class implements the <xref:System.ComponentModel.ISupportInitialize> interface to support XAML declaration of a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList>. If the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> is declared in XAML and attached to the current <xref:System.Windows.Application>, it is automatically applied to the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] shell when the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> is initialized.  \n  \n## Setting and Modifying a Jump List in Code  \n You attach a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> to an <xref:System.Windows.Application> object in code by calling the static <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList.SetJumpList%2A> method. This also applies the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> to the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] shell.  \n  \n To modify a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> at run time, you call the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList.GetJumpList%2A> method to get the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> that is currently attached to an <xref:System.Windows.Application>. After you have modified the properties of the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList>, you must call the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList.Apply%2A> method to apply the changes to the Windows shell.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  You typically create one <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> that is attached to the <xref:System.Windows.Application> and applied to the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] shell. However, you can create multiple <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> objects. Only one <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> at a time can be applied to the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] shell, and only one <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> at a time can be associated with an <xref:System.Windows.Application>. The .NET Framework does not require that these be the same <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList>.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This class contains a link demand at the class level that applies to all members. A <xref:System.Security.SecurityException> is thrown when the immediate caller does not have full-trust permission.

Jump Lists are also used in the [!INCLUDE[win7](~/includes/win7-md.md)] Start menu. You access a Jump List by right-clicking a taskbar button or by clicking the arrow next to a program in the Start menu. For more information about Jump Lists, see the [Taskbar](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=178478) section of the Windows User Experience Interaction Guidelines.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> class provides a managed wrapper for the Jump List functionality in the [!INCLUDE[win7](~/includes/win7-md.md)] taskbar and manages the data passed to the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] shell. The functionality exposed by the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> class is not available in versions of [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] earlier than [!INCLUDE[win7](~/includes/win7-md.md)]. Applications that use the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> class will run in other versions of [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)], but the Jump List will not be available. For more information about the Windows shell and native Jump List APIs, see [Taskbar Extensions](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=178479).  \\n  \\n The following illustration shows the Jump List for Windows Media Player, with items in the **Tasks** and **Frequent** categories.  \\n  \\n ![Windows Media Player Jump List](~/add/media/wpfshell-jumplist.png \\\"Windows Media Player Jump List\\\")  \\nWindows Media Player Jump List  \\n  \\n## Configuring a Jump List  \\n Jump Lists can contain two types of items, a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpTask> and a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpPath>. A <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpTask> is a link to a program and a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpPath> is a link to a file. You can visually separate items in a Jump List by creating a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpTask> that does not have a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpTask.Title%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpItem.CustomCategory%2A> specified. This empty <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpTask> will be displayed as a horizontal line in the Jump List.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  If the type of the file specified in a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpPath> is not registered with your application, the file will not appear in the Jump List. For example, if you add a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpPath> that points to a .txt file, your application must be registered to handle .txt files. For more information, see [Introduction to File Associations](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=178480).  \\n  \\n Jump items are placed into categories in the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList>. By default, a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpItem> is displayed in the **Tasks** category. Alternatively, you can specify a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpItem.CustomCategory%2A> for the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpItem>.  \\n  \\n You can specify whether the standard **Recent** and **Frequent** categories are displayed in the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList.ShowRecentCategory%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList.ShowFrequentCategory%2A> properties. The contents of these categories are managed by the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] shell. Because these categories might contain much of the same data, you typically display one or the other in your <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList>, but not both. [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] automatically manages recent items if they are opened through a common file dialog box or used to open an application through file type association. When an item is accessed through the Jump List, you can notify the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] shell to add the item to the **Recent** category by calling the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList.AddToRecentCategory%2A> method.  \\n  \\n## Applying a Jump List to the Windows Shell  \\n You cannot access the shell’s Jump List directly or read its contents into the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> class. Instead, the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> class provides a representation of a Jump List that you can work with, and then apply to the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] shell. You typically create a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> and set it one time when the application is first run. However, you can modify or replace the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> at run time.  \\n  \\n When you have set the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> properties, you must apply the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> to the Windows shell before its contents appear in the taskbar Jump List. This is done automatically when the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> is first attached to an application, either in XAML or in a call to the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList.SetJumpList%2A> method. If you modify the contents of the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> at run time, you must call the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList.Apply%2A> method to apply its current contents to the Windows shell.  \\n  \\n## Setting a Jump List in XAML  \\n A <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> is not automatically attached to an <xref:System.Windows.Application> object. You attach a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> to an <xref:System.Windows.Application> object in XAML by using the attached property syntax. The <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> class implements the <xref:System.ComponentModel.ISupportInitialize> interface to support XAML declaration of a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList>. If the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> is declared in XAML and attached to the current <xref:System.Windows.Application>, it is automatically applied to the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] shell when the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> is initialized.  \\n  \\n## Setting and Modifying a Jump List in Code  \\n You attach a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> to an <xref:System.Windows.Application> object in code by calling the static <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList.SetJumpList%2A> method. This also applies the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> to the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] shell.  \\n  \\n To modify a <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> at run time, you call the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList.GetJumpList%2A> method to get the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> that is currently attached to an <xref:System.Windows.Application>. After you have modified the properties of the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList>, you must call the <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList.Apply%2A> method to apply the changes to the Windows shell.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  You typically create one <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> that is attached to the <xref:System.Windows.Application> and applied to the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] shell. However, you can create multiple <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> objects. Only one <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> at a time can be applied to the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](~/includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] shell, and only one <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList> at a time can be associated with an <xref:System.Windows.Application>. The .NET Framework does not require that these be the same <xref:System.Windows.Shell.JumpList>.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  This class contains a link demand at the class level that applies to all members. A <xref:System.Security.SecurityException> is thrown when the immediate caller does not have full-trust permission. For more information about security demands, see [Link Demands](~/docs/framework/misc/link-demands.md) and [Inheritance Demands](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/28b9adbb-8f08-4f10-b856-dbf59eb932d9).\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following example shows an application with a Jump List.
