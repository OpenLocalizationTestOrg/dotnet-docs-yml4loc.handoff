System.Windows.Forms\n  namespace: System.Windows.Forms\n  summary: Represents a Windows control that allows the user to select a date and a time and to display the date and time with a specified format.\n  remarks: \"The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker> control is used to allow the user to select a date and time, and to display that date and time in the specified format. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker> control makes it easy to work with dates and times because it handles a lot of the data validation automatically.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker> control only supports Gregorian calendars.  \\n  \\n When used to represent a date, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker> control appears in two parts: a drop-down list with a date represented in text, and a calendar that appears when you click the down-arrow next to the list. The calendar looks like the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MonthCalendar> control, which can be used for selecting multiple dates. For more information about the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MonthCalendar> control, see [MonthCalendar Control Overview](~/docs/framework/winforms/controls/monthcalendar-control-overview-windows-forms.md).  \\n  \\n You can change the look of the calendar portion of the control by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker.CalendarForeColor%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker.CalendarFont%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker.CalendarTitleBackColor%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker.CalendarTitleForeColor%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker.CalendarTrailingForeColor%2A>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker.CalendarMonthBackground%2A> properties.  \\n  \\n To use a spin button control (also known as an up-down control) to adjust the date/time value, set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker.ShowUpDown%2A> property to `true`. The calendar will not drop down when the control is selected. The date and time can be adjusted by selecting each element individually and using the up and down buttons to change the value.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker.Value%2A> property contains the current date and time the control is set to. You can use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker.Text%2A> property or the appropriate member of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker.Value%2A> to get the date and time value. For more information, see [How to: Set and Return Dates with the Windows Forms DateTimePicker Control](~/docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-set-and-return-dates-with-the-windows-forms-datetimepicker-control.md). You can limit the dates and times that can be selected by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker.MinDate%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker.MaxDate%2A> properties.  \\n  \\n The values can be displayed in four formats, which are set by the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker.Format%2A> property: <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePickerFormat.Long>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePickerFormat.Short>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePickerFormat.Time>, or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePickerFormat.Custom>. The default date <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker.Format%2A> is <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePickerFormat?displayProperty=fullName>.  \\n  \\n If you want the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker> to appear as a control for picking or editing times instead of dates, set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker.ShowUpDown%2A> property to `true` and the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker.Format%2A> property to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePickerFormat.Time>. For more information, see [How to: Display Time with the DateTimePicker Control](~/docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-display-time-with-the-datetimepicker-control.md).  \\n  \\n If the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker.Format%2A> property is set to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePickerFormat?displayProperty=fullName>, you can create your own format style by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker.CustomFormat%2A> property and building a custom format string. The custom format string can be a combination of custom field characters and other literal characters. For example, you can display the date as \\\"June 01, 2012 - Friday\\\" by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker.CustomFormat%2A> property to \\\"MMMM dd, yyyy - dddd\\\". For more information, see [How to: Display a Date in a Custom Format with the Windows Forms DateTimePicker Control](~/docs/framework/winforms/controls/display-a-date-in-a-custom-format-with-wf-datetimepicker-control.md) and [Custom Date and Time Format Strings](~/docs/standard/base-types/custom-date-and-time-format-strings.md).  \\n  \\n> [!CAUTION]\\n>  When a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker> is data-bound and the backing value is changed to `null`, the value of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker> will not be updated and the previous value will be retained. In situations where this behavior is not desirable (for example, when using a set of data-bound controls to page through a recordset) use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Binding.Format> event of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Binding> class to set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker> to a value recognizable as a `null`.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example creates an new instance of a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker> control and initializes it. The control's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker.CustomFormat%2A> property is set. Also, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker.ShowCheckBox%2A> property is set so that the control displays a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CheckBox>, and the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker.ShowUpDown%2A> property is set so that the control is displayed as a spin button control. To run this example, paste the following code into a form and call the `CreateMyDateTimePicker` method in the example form’s constructor or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Load> event handling method.  \\n  \\n [!code-cpp[Classic DateTimePicker Example#1](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/Classic DateTimePicker Example/CPP/source.cpp#1)]\\n [!code-csharp[Classic DateTimePicker Example#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/Classic DateTimePicker Example/CS/source.cs#1)]\\n [!code-vb[Classic DateTimePicker Example#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/Classic DateTimePicker Example/VB/source.vb#1)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: >-\n      [System.ComponentModel.DefaultBindingProperty(\"Value\")]\n\n      [System.Runtime.InteropServices.ClassInterface(System.Runtime.InteropServices.ClassInterfaceType.AutoDispatch)]\n\n      [System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComVisible(true)]\n\n      public class DateTimePicker : System.Windows.Forms.Control\n  inheritance:\n  -
