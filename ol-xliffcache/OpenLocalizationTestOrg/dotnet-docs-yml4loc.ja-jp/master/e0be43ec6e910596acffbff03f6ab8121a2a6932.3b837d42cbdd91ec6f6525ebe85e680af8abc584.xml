A <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.ChangeMonitor> instance monitors changes in the state of data which a cache item depends on. For example, the item can be a file or data entity whose contents are cached. If the file or data entity is updated, the associated cache entry must be changed also. Common items that can be monitored include data entities (such as database fields, values, rows, or tables), another cache entry, and files and file attributes.  \\n  \\n A dependency change is a change in the state of a dependency. In a typical cache implementation, after a <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.ChangeMonitor> instance notifies the cache that a dependency has changed, the cache performs the required action, such as invalidating the inserted cache entry.  \\n  \\n Derived <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.ChangeMonitor> classes can be customized to monitor dependency changes for specific different data stores.

When the insertion attempt causes an exception, the cache implementation must dispose any associated dependencies.  \\n  \\n    -   If the cache entry is removed, the cache implementation must also dispose the dependency.  \\n  \\n The internal implementation of the <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.ChangeMonitor.OnChanged%2A> method automatically calls the <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.ChangeMonitor.Dispose%2A> method after it calls a callback that is registered through the <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.ChangeMonitor.NotifyOnChanged%2A> method.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  This automatic dispose during the event firing only occurs if the initialization of the <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.ChangeMonitor> instance previously completed.  \\n  \\n When a derived change monitor's constructor calls the <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.ChangeMonitor.InitializationComplete%2A> method, if the state of the change monitor has already changed (that is, the state that is monitored has already changed when the constructor was still active) then <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.ChangeMonitor.InitializationComplete%2A> method will automatically dispose the change monitor.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  Users should not call the <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.ChangeMonitor.Dispose%2A> method.

If you associate one or more change monitors with the cache item, you pass a <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.CacheItemPolicy> instance with a populated change monitors property to the cache item.
