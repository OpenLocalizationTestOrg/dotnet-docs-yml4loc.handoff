The type argument of the <xref:System.Lazy%601> object that you create specifies the type of the object that you want to initialize lazily. The constructor that you use to create the <xref:System.Lazy%601> object determines the characteristics of the initialization. Lazy initialization occurs the first time the <xref:System.Lazy%601.Value%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property is accessed.  \n  \n In most cases, choosing a constructor depends on your answers to two questions:  \n  \n-   Will the lazily initialized object be accessed from more than one thread? If so, the <xref:System.Lazy%601> object might create it on any thread. You can use one of the simple constructors whose default behavior is to create a thread-safe <xref:System.Lazy%601> object, so that only one instance of the lazily instantiated object is created no matter how many threads try to access it. To create a <xref:System.Lazy%601> object that is not thread safe, you must use a constructor that enables you to specify no thread safety.  \n  \n    > [!CAUTION]\n    >  Making the <xref:System.Lazy%601> object thread safe does not protect the lazily initialized object. If multiple threads can access the lazily initialized object, you must make its properties and methods safe for multithreaded access.  \n  \n-   Does lazy initialization require a lot of code, or does the lazily initialized object have a default constructor that does everything you need and doesn't throw exceptions? If you need to write initialization code or if exceptions need to be handled, use one of the constructors that takes a factory method. Write your initialization code in the factory method.  \n  \n The following table shows which constructor to choose, based on these two factors:  \n  \n|Object will be accessed by|If no initialization code is required (default constructor), use|If initialization code is required, use|  \n|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|  \n|Multiple threads|<xref:System.Lazy%601.%23ctor>|<xref:System.Lazy%601.%23ctor%28System.Func%7B%600%7D%29>|  \n|One thread|<xref:System.Lazy%601.%23ctor%28System.Boolean%29> with `isThreadSafe` set to `false`.|<xref:System.Lazy%601.%23ctor%28System.Func%7B%600%7D%2CSystem.Boolean%29> with `isThreadSafe` set to `false`.|  \n  \n You can use a lambda expression to specify the factory method. This keeps all the initialization code in one place. The lambda expression captures the context, including any arguments you pass to the lazily initialized object's constructor.  \n  \n **Exception caching** When you use factory methods, exceptions are cached. That is, if the factory method throws an exception the first time a thread tries to access the <xref:System.Lazy%601.Value%2A> property of the <xref:System.Lazy%601> object, the same exception is thrown on every subsequent attempt. This ensures that every call to the <xref:System.Lazy%601.Value%2A> property produces the same result and avoids subtle errors that might arise if different threads get different results. The <xref:System.Lazy%601> stands in for an actual `T` that otherwise would have been initialized at some earlier point, usually during startup. A failure at that earlier point is usually fatal. If there is a potential for a recoverable failure, we recommend that you build the retry logic into the initialization routine (in this case, the factory method), just as you would if you weren’t using lazy initialization.  \n  \n **Alternative to locking** In certain situations, you might want to avoid the overhead of the <xref:System.Lazy%601> object's default locking behavior. In rare situations, there might be a potential for deadlocks. In such cases, you can use the <xref:System.Lazy%601.%23ctor%28System.Threading.LazyThreadSafetyMode%29> or <xref:System.Lazy%601.%23ctor%28System.Func%7B%600%7D%2CSystem.Threading.LazyThreadSafetyMode%29> constructor, and specify <xref:System.Threading.LazyThreadSafetyMode?displayProperty=fullName>. This enables the <xref:System.Lazy%601> object to create a copy of the lazily initialized object on each of several threads if the threads call the <xref:System.Lazy%601.Value%2A> property simultaneously. The <xref:System.Lazy%601> object ensures that all threads use the same instance of the lazily initialized object and discards the instances that are not used. Thus, the cost of reducing the locking overhead is that your program might sometimes create and discard extra copies of an expensive object. In most cases, this is unlikely. The examples for the <xref:System.Lazy%601.%23ctor%28System.Threading.LazyThreadSafetyMode%29> and <xref:System.Lazy%601.%23ctor%28System.Func%7B%600%7D%2CSystem.Threading.LazyThreadSafetyMode%29> constructors demonstrate this behavior.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  When you specify <xref:System.Threading.LazyThreadSafetyMode.PublicationOnly>, exceptions are never cached, even if you specify a factory method.  \n  \n **Equivalent constructors** In addition to enabling the use of <xref:System.Threading.LazyThreadSafetyMode.PublicationOnly>, the <xref:System.Lazy%601.%23ctor%28System.Threading.LazyThreadSafetyMode%29> and <xref:System.Lazy%601.%23ctor%28System.Func%7B%600%7D%2CSystem.Threading.LazyThreadSafetyMode%29> constructors can duplicate the functionality of the other constructors.

initialization.\n  remarks: \"Use lazy initialization to defer the creation of a large or resource-intensive object, or the execution of a resource-intensive task, particularly when such creation or execution might not occur during the lifetime of the program.  \\n  \\n To prepare for lazy initialization, you create an instance of <xref:System.Lazy%601>. The type argument of the <xref:System.Lazy%601> object that you create specifies the type of the object that you want to initialize lazily. The constructor that you use to create the <xref:System.Lazy%601> object determines the characteristics of the initialization. Lazy initialization occurs the first time the <xref:System.Lazy%601.Value%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property is accessed.  \\n  \\n In most cases, choosing a constructor depends on your answers to two questions:  \\n  \\n-   Will the lazily initialized object be accessed from more than one thread? If so, the <xref:System.Lazy%601> object might create it on any thread. You can use one of the simple constructors whose default behavior is to create a thread-safe <xref:System.Lazy%601> object, so that only one instance of the lazily instantiated object is created no matter how many threads try to access it. To create a <xref:System.Lazy%601> object that is not thread safe, you must use a constructor that enables you to specify no thread safety.  \\n  \\n    > [!CAUTION]\\n    >  Making the <xref:System.Lazy%601> object thread safe does not protect the lazily initialized object. If multiple threads can access the lazily initialized object, you must make its properties and methods safe for multithreaded access.  \\n  \\n-   Does lazy initialization require a lot of code, or does the lazily initialized object have a default constructor that does everything you need and doesn't throw exceptions? If you need to write initialization code or if exceptions need to be handled, use one of the constructors that takes a factory method. Write your initialization code in the factory method.  \\n  \\n The following table shows which constructor to choose, based on these two factors:  \\n  \\n|Object will be accessed by|If no initialization code is required (default constructor), use|If initialization code is required, use|  \\n|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|  \\n|Multiple threads|<xref:System.Lazy%601.%23ctor>|<xref:System.Lazy%601.%23ctor%28System.Func%7B%600%7D%29>|  \\n|One thread|<xref:System.Lazy%601.%23ctor%28System.Boolean%29> with `isThreadSafe` set to `false`.|<xref:System.Lazy%601.%23ctor%28System.Func%7B%600%7D%2CSystem.Boolean%29> with `isThreadSafe` set to `false`.|  \\n  \\n You can use a lambda expression to specify the factory method. This keeps all the initialization code in one place. The lambda expression captures the context, including any arguments you pass to the lazily initialized object's constructor.  \\n  \\n **Exception caching** When you use factory methods, exceptions are cached. That is, if the factory method throws an exception the first time a thread tries to access the <xref:System.Lazy%601.Value%2A> property of the <xref:System.Lazy%601> object, the same exception is thrown on every subsequent attempt. This ensures that every call to the <xref:System.Lazy%601.Value%2A> property produces the same result and avoids subtle errors that might arise if different threads get different results. The <xref:System.Lazy%601> stands in for an actual `T` that otherwise would have been initialized at some earlier point, usually during startup. A failure at that earlier point is usually fatal. If there is a potential for a recoverable failure, we recommend that you build the retry logic into the initialization routine (in this case, the factory method), just as you would if you weren’t using lazy initialization.  \\n  \\n **Alternative to locking** In certain situations, you might want to avoid the overhead of the <xref:System.Lazy%601> object's default locking behavior. In rare situations, there might be a potential for deadlocks. In such cases, you can use the <xref:System.Lazy%601.%23ctor%28System.Threading.LazyThreadSafetyMode%29> or <xref:System.Lazy%601.%23ctor%28System.Func%7B%600%7D%2CSystem.Threading.LazyThreadSafetyMode%29> constructor, and specify <xref:System.Threading.LazyThreadSafetyMode?displayProperty=fullName>. This enables the <xref:System.Lazy%601> object to create a copy of the lazily initialized object on each of several threads if the threads call the <xref:System.Lazy%601.Value%2A> property simultaneously. The <xref:System.Lazy%601> object ensures that all threads use the same instance of the lazily initialized object and discards the instances that are not used. Thus, the cost of reducing the locking overhead is that your program might sometimes create and discard extra copies of an expensive object. In most cases, this is unlikely. The examples for the <xref:System.Lazy%601.%23ctor%28System.Threading.LazyThreadSafetyMode%29> and <xref:System.Lazy%601.%23ctor%28System.Func%7B%600%7D%2CSystem.Threading.LazyThreadSafetyMode%29> constructors demonstrate this behavior.  \\n  \\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\n>  When you specify <xref:System.Threading.LazyThreadSafetyMode.PublicationOnly>, exceptions are never cached, even if you specify a factory method.  \\n  \\n **Equivalent constructors** In addition to enabling the use of <xref:System.Threading.LazyThreadSafetyMode.PublicationOnly>, the <xref:System.Lazy%601.%23ctor%28System.Threading.LazyThreadSafetyMode%29> and <xref:System.Lazy%601.%23ctor%28System.Func%7B%600%7D%2CSystem.Threading.LazyThreadSafetyMode%29> constructors can duplicate the functionality of the other constructors. The following table shows the parameter values that produce equivalent behavior.  \\n  \\n|To create a <xref:System.Lazy%601> object that is|For constructors that have a `LazyThreadSafetyMode` `mode` parameter, set `mode` to|For constructors that have a Boolean `isThreadSafe` parameter, set `isThreadSafe` to|For constructors with no thread safety parameters|  \\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|  \\n|Fully thread safe; uses locking to ensure that only one thread initializes the value.|<xref:System.Threading.LazyThreadSafetyMode.ExecutionAndPublication>|`true`|All such constructors are fully thread safe.|  \\n|Not thread safe.|<xref:System.Threading.LazyThreadSafetyMode.None>|`false`|Not applicable.|  \\n|Fully thread safe; threads race to initialize the value.|<xref:System.Threading.LazyThreadSafetyMode.PublicationOnly>|Not applicable.|Not applicable.|  \\n  \\n **Other capabilities** For information about the use of <xref:System.Lazy%601> with thread-static fields, or as the backing store for properties, see [Lazy Initialization](~/docs/framework/performance/lazy-initialization.md).\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following example demonstrates the use of the <xref:System.Lazy%601> class to provide lazy initialization with access from multiple threads.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  The example uses the <xref:System.Lazy%601.%23ctor%28System.Func%7B%600%7D%29> constructor.

At the beginning of the `Main` method, the example creates the <xref:System.Lazy%601> object that performs lazy initialization of the `LargeObject`:  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[System.Lazy\\\\`1.ctorFuncLTSM#NewLazy](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.lazy`1.ctorfuncltsm/cs/example.cs#newlazy)]\\n [!code-vb[System.Lazy\\\\`1.ctorFuncLTSM#NewLazy](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.lazy`1.ctorfuncltsm/vb/example.vb#newlazy)]  \\n  \\n The lazy initializer uses a function to perform the initialization. In this case, a function is required because there is no default constructor for the `LargeObject` class.  \\n  \\n The example creates and starts three threads that block on a <xref:System.Threading.ManualResetEvent> object, so that the example can release the threads all at once. In the `ThreadProc` method that's used by all three threads, calling the <xref:System.Lazy%601.Value%2A> property creates the `LargeObject` instance:  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[System.Lazy\\\\`1.ctorFuncLTSM#ValueProp](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.lazy`1.ctorfuncltsm/cs/example.cs#valueprop)]\\n [!code-vb[System.Lazy\\\\`1.ctorFuncLTSM#ValueProp](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.lazy`1.ctorfuncltsm/vb/example.vb#valueprop)]  \\n  \\n In the third key section of code, the lazy initialization function is called to create the `LargeObject` instance. The function throws an exception the first time it's called:  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[System.Lazy\\\\`1.ctorFuncLTSM#FactoryFunc](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.lazy`1.ctorfuncltsm/cs/example.cs#factoryfunc)]\\n [!code-vb[System.Lazy\\\\`1.ctorFuncLTSM#FactoryFunc](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.lazy`1.ctorfuncltsm/vb/example.vb#factoryfunc)]  \\n  \\n With any other <xref:System.Threading.LazyThreadSafetyMode> setting, an unhandled exception in the initialization function would be cached. However, <xref:System.Threading.LazyThreadSafetyMode.PublicationOnly> suppresses exception caching. The output from the example demonstrates that a subsequent attempt to initialize the object succeeds.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  The exception message usually appears after messages indicating that other threads have successfully initialized the object. This is because of the delay introduced by throwing and catching the exception.  \\n  \\n Because the constructor for the <xref:System.Lazy%601> instance specified <xref:System.Threading.LazyThreadSafetyMode?displayProperty=fullName>, all three threads are allowed to create `LargeObject` instances. The example demonstrates this by displaying console messages in the constructor and in the finalizer of the `LargeObject` class:  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[System.Lazy\\\\`1.ctorFuncLTSM#CtorFinalizer](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.lazy`1.ctorfuncltsm/cs/example.cs#ctorfinalizer)]\\n [!code-vb[System.Lazy\\\\`1.ctorFuncLTSM#CtorFinalizer](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.lazy`1.ctorfuncltsm/vb/example.vb#ctorfinalizer)]  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Lazy%601> object ensures that only one instance is used by all threads (except the thread where the initialization function throws an exception). The output from the example shows this.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  For simplicity, this example uses a global instance of <xref:System.Lazy%601>, and all the methods are `static` (`Shared` in Visual Basic). These are not requirements for the use of lazy initialization.  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[System.Lazy\\\\`1.ctorFuncLTSM#All](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.lazy`1.ctorfuncltsm/cs/example.cs#all)]\\n [!code-vb[System.Lazy\\\\`1.ctorFuncLTSM#All](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.lazy`1.ctorfuncltsm/vb/example.vb#all)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public Lazy (Func<T> valueFactory, System.Threading.LazyThreadSafetyMode mode);\n    parameters:\n    - id: valueFactory\n      type: System.Func{T}\n      description: The delegate that is invoked to produce the lazily initialized value when it is needed.\n    - id: mode\n      type: System.Threading.LazyThreadSafetyMode\n      description: One of the enumeration values that specifies the thread safety mode.\n  overload: System.Lazy`1.#ctor*\n  exceptions:\n  - type: System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException\n    commentId: T:System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException\n    description: <code>mode</code> contains an invalid value.\n  - type: System.ArgumentNullException\n    commentId: T:System.ArgumentNullException\n    description: <code>valueFactory</code> is `null`.\n  version:\n  - netcore-1.0\n  - netcore-1.1\n  - netcore-2.0\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  - netstandard-1.0\n  - netstandard-1.1\n  - netstandard-1.2\n  - netstandard-1.3\n  - netstandard-1.4\n  - netstandard-1.5\n  - netstandard-1.6\n  - netstandard-2.0\n  - xamarinandroid-7.1\n  - xamarinios-10.8\n  - xamarinmac-3.0\n  monikers:\n  - netcore-1.0\n  - netcore-1.1\n  - netcore-2.0\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  - netstandard-1.0\n  - netstandard-1.1\n  - netstandard-1.2\n  - netstandard-1.3\n  - netstandard-1.4\n  - netstandard-1.5\n  - netstandard-1.6\n  - netstandard-2.0\n  - xamarinandroid-7.1\n  - xamarinios-10.8\n  - xamarinmac-3.0\n  content_git_url: https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/xml/System/Lazy`1.xml\n  ms.technology:\n  - dotnet-standard\n  author: rpetrusha\n  ms.author: ronpet\n  manager: wpickett\n- uid: System.Lazy`1.IsValueCreated\n  commentId: P:System.Lazy`1.IsValueCreated\n  id: IsValueCreated\n  parent: System.Lazy`1\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: IsValueCreated\n  nameWithType: Lazy<T>.IsValueCreated\n  fullName: Lazy<T>.IsValueCreated\n  type: Property\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Runtime\n  - mscorlib\n  - netstandard\n  namespace: System\n  summary: Gets a value that indicates whether a value has been created for this <xref href=\"System.Lazy`1\"></xref> instance.\n  remarks: \"When lazy initialization occurs for a <xref:System.Lazy%601> instance, it may result in either a value being created or an exception being thrown.
