System counters within this category track memory data such as the number of bytes available and the number of bytes cached. If you wanted to work with the bytes cached in your application, you would create an instance of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter> component, connect it to the Memory category, and then pick the appropriate counter (in this case, Cached Bytes) from that category.  \n  \n Although your system makes many more counter categories available, the categories that you will probably interact with most frequently are the Cache, Memory, Objects, PhysicalDisk, Process, Processor, Server, System, and Thread categories.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter.RemoveInstance%2A> method in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter> class will release the counter and, if the reuse option is selected for that category, the instance of the counter will be reused.

If a highly privileged application locks the named mutex, attempts to create or delete a performance counter causes the application to stop responding until the lock is released. To help avoid this problem, never grant <xref:System.Security.Permissions.SecurityPermissionFlag.UnmanagedCode> permission to untrusted code. In addition, <xref:System.Security.Permissions.SecurityPermissionFlag.UnmanagedCode> permission potentially allows other permissions to be bypassed and should only be granted to highly trusted code.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterCategory> instance's <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterCategory.CategoryName%2A> property is displayed in the Performance Object field of the Performance Viewer application's Add Counter dialog box.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterCategory> class provides several methods for interacting with counters and categories on the computer. The <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterCategory.Create%2A> methods enable you to define custom categories. The <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterCategory.Delete%2A> method provides a way to remove categories from the computer. The <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterCategory.GetCategories%2A> method enables you to view the list of categories, while <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterCategory.ReadCategory%2A> retrieves all the counter and instance data associated with a single category.  \\n  \\n A performance counter publishes performance data about an application. Categories include physical components (such as processors, disks, and memory) and system objects (such as processes and threads). System counters that are related to the same performance object are grouped into a category that indicates their common focus. When you create an instance of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter> class, you first indicate the category with which the component will interact, and then you choose a counter from that category.  \\n  \\n For example, one Windows counter category is the Memory category. System counters within this category track memory data such as the number of bytes available and the number of bytes cached. If you wanted to work with the bytes cached in your application, you would create an instance of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter> component, connect it to the Memory category, and then pick the appropriate counter (in this case, Cached Bytes) from that category.  \\n  \\n Although your system makes many more counter categories available, the categories that you will probably interact with most frequently are the Cache, Memory, Objects, PhysicalDisk, Process, Processor, Server, System, and Thread categories.  \\n  \\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\n>  The <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter.RemoveInstance%2A> method in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter> class will release the counter and, if the reuse option is selected for that category, the instance of the counter will be reused. This could cause a race condition if another process or even another part of the code is trying to write to the counter instance.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  It is strongly recommended that new performance counter categories be created during the installation of the application, not during the execution of the application. This allows time for the operating system to refresh its list of registered performance counter categories. If the list has not been refreshed, the attempt to use the category will fail.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  Performance counter categories installed with the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnlong](~/includes/dnprdnlong-md.md)] use separate shared memory, with each performance counter category having its own memory. You can specify the size of separate shared memory by creating a DWORD named FileMappingSize in the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Services\\\\\\\\*\\\\<category name>*\\\\Performance. The FileMappingSize value is set to the shared memory size of the category. The default size is 131072 decimal. If the FileMappingSize value is not present, the `fileMappingSize` attribute value for the `performanceCounters` element specified in the Machine.config file is used, causing additional overhead for configuration file processing. You can realize a performance improvement for application startup by setting the file mapping size in the registry. For more information about the file mapping size, see [\\\\&lt;performanceCounters\\\\&gt;](~/docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/trace-debug/performancecounters-element.md).\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example determines whether a <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter> and its <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterCategory> exist on the local computer or on another computer. If these objects do not exist on the local computer, the example optionally creates them. It uses the <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterCategory.Exists%2A> method to determine whether the <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterCategory> exists.  If the <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterCategory> does not exist and no counter name is specified, or if the computer is a remote machine, the example exits.  \\n  \\n If a <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter> name is provided, the example uses the <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterCategory.CounterExists%2A> method and displays the result to the user. If the <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter> does not exist, the user can delete and re-create the <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterCategory> with the new <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter>. If the user does so, the category is deleted using the <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterCategory.Delete%2A> method.  \\n  \\n If requested, the example now creates the new <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterCategory> and <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter> using the <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterCategory.Create%2A> method.
