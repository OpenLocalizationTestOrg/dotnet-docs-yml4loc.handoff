However, in some languages such as C and C++, a null character indicates the end of a string;it is not considered a part of the string and is not counted as part of the string's length. This means that the following common assumptions that C and C++ programmers or libraries written in C or C++ might make about strings are not necessarily valid when applied to <xref:System.String> objects:  \n  \n-   The value returned by the `strlen` or `wcslen` functions does not necessarily equal <xref:System.String.Length%2A?displayProperty=fullName>.  \n  \n-   The string created by the `strcpy_s` or `wcscpy_s` functions is not necessarily identical to the string created by the <xref:System.String.Copy%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method.  \n  \n You should ensure that native C and C++ code that instantiates <xref:System.String> objects, and code that is passed <xref:System.String> objects through platform invoke, do not assume that an embedded null character marks the end of the string.  \n  \n Embedded null characters in a string are also treated differently when a string is sorted (or compared) and when a string is searched. Null characters are ignored when performing culture-sensitive comparisons between two strings, including comparisons using the invariant culture. They are considered only for ordinal or case-insensitive ordinal comparisons. On the other hand, embedded null characters are always considered when searching a string with methods such as <xref:System.String.Contains%2A>, <xref:System.String.StartsWith%2A>, and <xref:System.String.IndexOf%2A>.  \n  \n<a name=\"Indexes\"></a>   \n## Strings and indexes  \n An index is the position of a <xref:System.Char> object (not a Unicode character) in a <xref:System.String>. An index is a zero-based, nonnegative number that starts from the first position in the string, which is index position zero. A number of search methods, such as <xref:System.String.IndexOf%2A> and <xref:System.String.LastIndexOf%2A>, return the index of a character or substring in the string instance.  \n  \n The <xref:System.String.Chars%2A> property lets you access individual <xref:System.Char> objects by their index position in the string. Because the <xref:System.String.Chars%2A> property is the default property (in Visual Basic) or the indexer (in C#), you can access the individual <xref:System.Char> objects in a string by using code such as the following. This code looks for white space or punctuation characters in a string to determine how many words the string contains.  \n  \n [!code-cpp[System.String.Class#4](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cpp/string.index1.cpp#4)]\n [!code-csharp[System.String.Class#4](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cs/index1.cs#4)]\n [!code-vb[System.String.Class#4](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/vb/index1.vb#4)]  \n  \n Because the <xref:System.String> class implements the <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerable> interface, you can also iterate through the <xref:System.Char> objects in a string by using a `foreach` construct, as the following example shows.  \n  \n [!code-cpp[System.String.Class#5](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cpp/string.index2.cpp#5)]\n [!code-csharp[System.String.Class#5](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cs/index2.cs#5)]\n [!code-vb[System.String.Class#5](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/vb/index2.vb#5)]  \n  \n Consecutive index values might not correspond to consecutive Unicode characters, because a Unicode character might be encoded as more than one <xref:System.Char> object. In particular, a string may contain multi-character units of text that are formed by a base character followed by one or more combining characters or by surrogate pairs. To work with Unicode characters instead of <xref:System.Char> objects, use the <xref:System.Globalization.StringInfo?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Globalization.TextElementEnumerator> classes. The following example illustrates the difference between code that works with <xref:System.Char> objects and code that works with Unicode characters.

You can also retrieve an array that contains the starting index of each text element by calling the <xref:System.Globalization.StringInfo.ParseCombiningCharacters%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method.  \n  \n For more information about working with units of text rather than individual <xref:System.Char> values, see the <xref:System.Globalization.StringInfo> class.  \n  \n<a name=\"Nulls\"></a>   \n## Null strings and empty strings  \n A string that has been declared but has not been assigned a value is `null`. Attempting to call methods on that string throws a <xref:System.NullReferenceException>. A null string is different from an empty string, which is a string whose value is \"\" or <xref:System.String.Empty?displayProperty=fullName>. In some cases, passing either a null string or an empty string as an argument in a method call throws an exception. For example, passing a null string to the <xref:System.Int32.Parse%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method throws an <xref:System.ArgumentNullException>, and passing an empty string throws a <xref:System.FormatException>. In other cases, a method argument can be either a null string or an empty string. For example, if you are providing an <xref:System.IFormattable> implementation for a class, you want to equate both a null string and an empty string with the general (\"G\") format specifier.  \n  \n The <xref:System.String> class includes the following two convenience methods that enable you to test whether a string is `null` or empty:  \n  \n-   <xref:System.String.IsNullOrEmpty%2A>, which indicates whether a string is either `null` or is equal to  <xref:System.String.Empty?displayProperty=fullName>.

An ordinal operation acts on the numeric value of each <xref:System.Char> object. A culture-sensitive operation acts on the value of the <xref:System.String>object, and takes culture-specific casing, sorting, formatting, and parsing rules into account. Culture-sensitive operations execute in the context of an explicitly declared culture or the implicit current culture. The two kinds of operations can produce very different results when they are performed on the same string.  \n  \n The .NET Framework also supports culture-insensitive linguistic string operations by using the invariant culture (<xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName>), which is loosely based on the culture settings of the English language independent of region. Unlike other <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo?displayProperty=fullName> settings, the settings of the invariant culture are guaranteed to remain consistent on a single computer, from system to system, and across versions of the .NET Framework. The invariant culture can be seen as a kind of black box that ensures stability of string comparisons and ordering across all cultures.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  If your application makes a security decision about a symbolic identifier such as a file name or named pipe, or about persisted data such as the text-based data in an XML file, the operation should use an ordinal comparison instead of a culture-sensitive comparison.

For example, instead of calling the <xref:System.String.Compare%28System.String%2CSystem.String%29> method to perform a culture-sensitive comparison of two strings by using the conventions of the current culture, you should call the <xref:System.String.Compare%28System.String%2CSystem.String%2CSystem.StringComparison%29> method with a value of <xref:System.StringComparison?displayProperty=fullName> for the `comparisonType` argument. For more information, see [Best Practices for Using Strings](~/docs/standard/base-types/best-practices-strings.md).  \n  \n<a name=\"casing\"></a>   \n### Casing  \n Casing rules determine how to change the capitalization of a Unicode character; for example, from lowercase to uppercase. Often, a casing operation is performed before a string comparison. For example, a string might be converted to uppercase so that it can be compared with another uppercase string. You can convert the characters in a string to lowercase by calling the <xref:System.String.ToLower%2A> or <xref:System.String.ToLowerInvariant%2A> method, and you can convert them to uppercase by calling the <xref:System.String.ToUpper%2A> or <xref:System.String.ToUpperInvariant%2A> method. In addition, you can use the <xref:System.Globalization.TextInfo.ToTitleCase%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method to convert a string to title case.  \n  \n Casing operations can be based on the rules of the current culture, a specified culture, or the invariant culture. Because case mappings can vary depending on the culture used, the result of casing operations can vary based on culture. The actual differences in casing are of three kinds:  \n  \n-   Differences in the case mapping of LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I (U+0049), LATIN SMALL LETTER I (U+0069), LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH DOT ABOVE (U+0130), and LATIN SMALL LETTER DOTLESS I (U+0131). In the tr-TR (Turkish (Turkey)) and az-Latn-AZ (Azerbaijan, Latin) cultures, and in the tr, az, and az-Latn neutral cultures, the lowercase equivalent of LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I is LATIN SMALL LETTER DOTLESS I, and the uppercase equivalent of LATIN SMALL LETTER I is LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH DOT ABOVE. In all other cultures, including the invariant culture, LATIN SMALL LETTER I and LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I are lowercase and uppercase equivalents.  \n  \n     The following example demonstrates how a string comparison designed to prevent file system access can fail if it relies on a culture-sensitive casing comparison. (The casing conventions of the invariant culture should have been used.)  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[System.String.Class#17](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cs/case2.cs#17)]\n     [!code-vb[System.String.Class#17](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/vb/case2.vb#17)]  \n  \n-   Differences in case mappings between the invariant culture and all other cultures. In these cases, using the casing rules of the invariant culture to change a character to uppercase or lowercase returns the same character. For all other cultures, it returns a different character. Some of the affected characters are listed in the following table.  \n  \n    |Character|If changed to|Returns|  \n    |---------------|-------------------|-------------|  \n    |MICRON SIGN (U+00B5)|Uppercase|GREEK CAPITAL LETTER MU (U+-39C)|  \n    |LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH DOT ABOVE (U+0130)|Lowercase|LATIN SMALL LETTER I (U+0069)|  \n    |LATIN SMALL LETTER DOTLESS I (U+0131)|Uppercase|LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I (U+0049)|  \n    |LATIN SMALL LETTER LONG S (U+017F)|Uppercase|LATIN CAPITAL LETTER S (U+0053)|  \n    |LATIN CAPITAL LETTER D WITH SMALL LETTER Z WITH CARON (U+01C5)|Lowercase|LATIN SMALL LETTER DZ WITH CARON (U+01C6)|  \n    |COMBINING GREEK YPOGEGRAMMENI (U+0345)|Uppercase|GREEK CAPITAL LETTER IOTA (U+0399)|  \n  \n-   Differences in case mappings of two-letter mixed-case pairs in the ASCII character range. In most cultures, a two-letter mixed-case pair is equal to the equivalent two-letter uppercase or lowercase pair. This is not true for the following two-letter pairs in the following cultures, because in each case they are compared to a digraph:  \n  \n    -   \"lJ\" and \"nJ\" in the hr-HR (Croatian (Croatia)) culture.  \n  \n    -   \"cH\" in the cs-CZ (Czech (Czech Republic)) and sk-SK (Slovak (Slovakia)) cultures.  \n  \n    -   \"aA\" in the da-DK (Danish (Denmark)) culture.  \n  \n    -   \"cS\", \"dZ\", \"dZS\", \"nY\", \"sZ\", \"tY\", and \"zS\" in the hu-HU (Hungarian (Hungary)) culture.  \n  \n    -   \"cH\" and \"lL\" in the es-ES_tradnl (Spanish (Spain, Traditional Sort)) culture.  \n  \n    -   \"cH\", \"gI\", \"kH\", \"nG\" \"nH\", \"pH\", \"qU', \"tH\", and \"tR\" in the vi-VN (Vietnamese (Vietnam)) culture.  \n  \n     However, it is unusual to encounter a situation in which a culture-sensitive comparison of these pairs creates problems, because these pairs are uncommon in fixed strings or identifiers.  \n  \n The following example illustrates some of the differences in casing rules between cultures when converting strings to uppercase.  \n  \n [!code-cpp[System.String.Class#7](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cpp/string.casing.cpp#7)]\n [!code-csharp[System.String.Class#7](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cs/case1.cs#7)]\n [!code-vb[System.String.Class#7](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/vb/case1.vb#7)]  \n  \n<a name=\"parsing\"></a>   \n### Parsing and formatting  \n Formatting and parsing are inverse operations. Formatting rules determine how to convert a value, such as a date and time or a number, to its string representation, whereas parsing rules determine how to convert a string representation to a value such as a date and time. Both formatting and parsing rules are dependent on cultural conventions. The following example illustrates the ambiguity that can arise when interpreting a culture-specific date string. Without knowing the conventions of the culture that was used to produce a date string, it is not possible to know whether 03/01/2011, 3/1/2011, and 01/03/2011 represent January 3, 2011 or March 1, 2011.  \n  \n [!code-cpp[System.String.Class#8](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cpp/string.format1.cpp#8)]\n [!code-csharp[System.String.Class#8](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cs/format1.cs#8)]\n [!code-vb[System.String.Class#8](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/vb/format1.vb#8)]  \n  \n Similarly, as the following example shows, a single string can produce different dates depending on the culture whose conventions are used in the parsing operation.  \n  \n [!code-cpp[System.String.Class#9](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cpp/string.parse1.cpp#9)]\n [!code-csharp[System.String.Class#9](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cs/parse1.cs#9)]\n [!code-vb[System.String.Class#9](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/vb/parse1.vb#9)]  \n  \n<a name=\"comparison\"></a>   \n### String comparison and sorting  \n Conventions for comparing and sorting strings vary from culture to culture. For example, the sort order may be based on phonetics or on the visual representation of characters. In East Asian languages, characters are sorted by the stroke and radical of ideographs. Sorting also depends on the order languages and cultures use for the alphabet. For example, the Danish language has an \"Æ\" character that it sorts after \"Z\" in the alphabet. In addition, comparisons can be case-sensitive or case-insensitive, and in some cases casing rules also differ by culture. Ordinal comparison, on the other hand, uses the Unicode code points of individual characters in a string when comparing and sorting strings.  \n  \n Sort rules determine the alphabetic order of Unicode characters and how two strings compare to each other. For example, the <xref:System.String.Compare%28System.String%2CSystem.String%2CSystem.StringComparison%29?displayProperty=fullName> method compares two strings based on the <xref:System.StringComparison> parameter. If the parameter value is <xref:System.StringComparison?displayProperty=fullName>, the method performs a linguistic comparison that uses the conventions of the current culture; if the parameter value is <xref:System.StringComparison?displayProperty=fullName>, the method performs an ordinal comparison. Consequently, as the following example shows, if the current culture is U.S. English, the first call to the <xref:System.String.Compare%28System.String%2CSystem.String%2CSystem.StringComparison%29?displayProperty=fullName> method (using culture-sensitive comparison) considers \"a\" less than \"A\", but the second call to the same method (using ordinal comparison) considers \"a\" greater than \"A\".  \n  \n [!code-cpp[System.String.Class#10](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cpp/string.compare1.cpp#10)]\n [!code-csharp[System.String.Class#10](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cs/compare1.cs#10)]\n [!code-vb[System.String.Class#10](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/vb/compare1.vb#10)]  \n  \n The .NET Framework supports word, string, and ordinal sort rules:  \n  \n-   A word sort performs a culture-sensitive comparison of strings in which certain nonalphanumeric Unicode characters might have special weights assigned to them. For example, the hyphen (-) might have a very small weight assigned to it so that \"coop\" and \"co-op\" appear next to each other in a sorted list. For a list of the <xref:System.String>methods that compare two strings using word sort rules, see the [String operations by category](#ByCategory) section.  \n  \n-   A string sort also performs a culture-sensitive comparison. It is similar to a word sort, except that there are no special cases, and all nonalphanumeric symbols come before all alphanumeric Unicode characters. Two strings can be compared using string sort rules by calling the <xref:System.Globalization.CompareInfo.Compare%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method overloads that have an `options` parameter that is supplied a value of <xref:System.Globalization.CompareOptions?displayProperty=fullName>. Note that this is the only method that the .NET Framework provides to compare two strings using string sort rules.  \n  \n-   An ordinal sort compares strings based on the numeric value of each <xref:System.Char> object in the string. An ordinal comparison is automatically case-sensitive because the lowercase and uppercase versions of a character have different code points. However, if case is not important, you can specify an ordinal comparison that ignores case. This is equivalent to converting the string to uppercase by using the invariant culture and then performing an ordinal comparison on the result. For a list of the <xref:System.String> methods that compare two strings using ordinal sort rules, see the [String operations by category](#ByCategory) section.  \n  \n A culture-sensitive comparison is any comparison that explicitly or implicitly uses a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object, including the invariant culture that is specified by the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property. The implicit culture is the current culture, which is specified by the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentCulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> properties. There is considerable variation in the sort order of alphabetic characters (that is, characters for which the <xref:System.Char.IsLetter%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property returns `true`) across cultures. You can specify a culture-sensitive comparison that uses the conventions of a specific culture by supplying a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object to a string comparison method such as <xref:System.String.Compare%28System.String%2CSystem.String%2CSystem.Globalization.CultureInfo%2CSystem.Globalization.CompareOptions%29>. You can specify a culture-sensitive comparison that uses the conventions of the current culture by supplying <xref:System.StringComparison?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.StringComparison?displayProperty=fullName>, or any member of the <xref:System.Globalization.CompareOptions> enumeration other than <xref:System.Globalization.CompareOptions?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.Globalization.CompareOptions?displayProperty=fullName> to an appropriate overload of the <xref:System.String.Compare%2A> method. A culture-sensitive comparison is generally appropriate for sorting whereas an ordinal comparison is not. An ordinal comparison is generally appropriate for determining whether two strings are equal (that is, for determining identity) whereas a culture-sensitive comparison is not.  \n  \n The following example illustrates the difference between culture-sensitive and ordinal comparison. The example evaluates three strings, \"Apple\", \"Æble\", and \"AEble\", using ordinal comparison and the conventions of the da-DK and en-US cultures (each of which is the default culture at the time the <xref:System.String.Compare%2A> method is called). Because the Danish language treats the character \"Æ\" as an individual letter and sorts it after \"Z\" in the alphabet, the string \"Æble\" is greater than \"Apple\". However, \"Æble\" is not considered equivalent to \"AEble\", so \"Æble\" is also greater than \"AEble\". The en-US culture doesn't include the letter\"Æ\" but treats it as equivalent to \"AE\", which explains why  \"Æble\" is less than \"Apple\" but equal to \"AEble\". Ordinal comparison, on the other hand, considers \"Apple\" to be less than \"Æble\", and \"Æble\" to be greater than \"AEble\".  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.String.Class#21](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cs/compare4.cs#21)]\n [!code-vb[System.String.Class#21](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/vb/compare4.vb#21)]  \n  \n Use the following general guidelines to choose an appropriate sorting or string comparison method:  \n  \n-   If you want the strings to be ordered based on the user's culture, you should order them based on the conventions of the current culture. If the user's culture changes, the order of sorted strings will also change accordingly. For example, a thesaurus application should always sort words based on the user's culture.  \n  \n-   If you want the strings to be ordered based on the conventions of a specific culture, you should order them by supplying a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object that represents that culture to a comparison method. For example, in an application designed to teach students a particular language, you want strings to be ordered based on the conventions of one of the cultures that speaks that language.  \n  \n-   If you want the order of strings to remain unchanged across cultures, you should order them based on the conventions of the invariant culture or use an ordinal comparison. For example, you would use an ordinal sort to organize the names of files, processes, mutexes, or named pipes.  \n  \n-   For a comparison that involves a security decision (such as whether a username is valid), you should always perform an ordinal test for equality by calling an overload of the <xref:System.String.Equals%2A> method.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The culture-sensitive sorting and casing rules used in string comparison depend on the version of the .NET Framework. In the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](~/includes/net-v45-md.md)] running on the [!INCLUDE[win8](~/includes/win8-md.md)] operating system, sorting, casing, normalization, and Unicode character information conforms to the Unicode 6.0 standard. On other operating systems, it conforms to the Unicode 5.0 standard.  \n  \n For more information about word, string, and ordinal sort rules, see the <xref:System.Globalization.CompareOptions?displayProperty=fullName> topic. For additional recommendations on when to use each rule, see [Best Practices for Using Strings](~/docs/standard/base-types/best-practices-strings.md).  \n  \n Ordinarily, you do not call string comparison methods such as <xref:System.String.Compare%2A> directly to determine the sort order of strings. Instead, comparison methods are called by sorting methods such as <xref:System.Array.Sort%2A?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601.Sort%2A?displayProperty=fullName>. The following example performs four different sorting operations (word sort using the current culture, word sort using the invariant culture, ordinal sort, and string sort using the invariant culture) without explicitly calling a string comparison method, although they do specify the type of comparison to use. Note that each type of sort produces a unique ordering of strings in its array.  \n  \n [!code-cpp[System.String.Class#12](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cpp/string.compare2.cpp#12)]\n [!code-csharp[System.String.Class#12](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cs/compare2.cs#12)]\n [!code-vb[System.String.Class#12](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/vb/compare2.vb#12)]  \n  \n> [!TIP]\n>  Internally, the.NET Framework uses sort keys to support culturallysensitive string comparison. Each character in a string is given several categories of sort weights, including alphabetic, case, and diacritic. A sort key, represented by the <xref:System.Globalization.SortKey> class, provides a repository of these weights for a particular string. If your app performs a large number of searching or sorting operations on the same set of strings, you can improve its performance by generating and storing sort keys for all the strings that it uses. When a sort or comparison operation is required, you use the sort keys instead of the strings. For more information, see the <xref:System.Globalization.SortKey> class.  \n  \n If you don't specify a string comparison convention, sorting methods such as <xref:System.Array.Sort%28System.Array%29?displayProperty=fullName> perform a culture-sensitive, case-sensitive sort on strings. The following example illustrates how changing the current culture affects the order of sorted strings in an array. It creates an array of three strings. First, it sets the `System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture` property to en-US and calls the <xref:System.Array.Sort%28System.Array%29?displayProperty=fullName> method. The resulting sort order is based on sorting conventions for the English (United States) culture. Next, the example sets the `System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture` property to da-DK and calls the <xref:System.Array.Sort%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method again. Notice how the resulting sort order differs from the en-US results because it uses the sorting conventions for Danish (Denmark).  \n  \n [!code-csharp[Conceptual.Strings.Comparing#3](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.strings.comparing/cs/sort1.cs#3)]\n [!code-vb[Conceptual.Strings.Comparing#3](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.strings.comparing/vb/sort1.vb#3)]  \n  \n> [!WARNING]\n>  If your primary purpose in comparing strings is to determine whether they are equal, you should call the <xref:System.String.Equals%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method. Typically, you should use <xref:System.String.Equals%2A> to perform an ordinal comparison. The <xref:System.String.Compare%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method is intended primarily to sort strings.  \n  \n String search methods, such as <xref:System.String.StartsWith%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.String.IndexOf%2A?displayProperty=fullName>, also can perform culture-sensitive or ordinal string comparisons. The following example illustrates the differences between ordinal and culture-sensitive comparisons using the <xref:System.String.IndexOf%2A> method. A culture-sensitive search in which the current culture is English (United States) considers the substring \"oe\" to match the ligature \"œ\". Because a soft hyphen (U+00AD) is a zero-width character, the search treats the soft hyphen as equivalent to <xref:System.String.Empty> and finds a match at the beginning of the string. An ordinal search, on the other hand, does not find a match in either case.  \n  \n [!code-cpp[System.String.Class#13](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cpp/string.compare3.cpp#13)]\n [!code-csharp[System.String.Class#13](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cs/compare3.cs#13)]\n [!code-vb[System.String.Class#13](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/vb/compare3.vb#13)]  \n  \n### Searching Strings  \n String search methods, such as <xref:System.String.StartsWith%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.String.IndexOf%2A?displayProperty=fullName>, also can perform culture-sensitive or ordinal string comparisons to determine whether a character or substring is found in a specified string.  \n  \n The search methods in the <xref:System.String> class that search for an individual character, such as the<xref:System.String.IndexOf%2A> method, or one of a set of characters,   such as the <xref:System.String.IndexOfAny%2A> method, all perform an ordinal search. To perform a culture-sensitive search for a character, you must call a <xref:System.Globalization.CompareInfo> method such as <xref:System.Globalization.CompareInfo.IndexOf%28System.String%2CSystem.Char%29?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.Globalization.CompareInfo.LastIndexOf%28System.String%2CSystem.Char%29?displayProperty=fullName>. Note that the results of searching for a character using ordinal and culture-sensitive comparison can be very different. For example, a search for a precomposed Unicode character such as the ligature \"Æ\" (U+00C6) might match any occurrence of its components in the correct sequence, such as \"AE\" (U+041U+0045), depending on the culture. The following example illustrates the difference between the <xref:System.String.IndexOf%28System.Char%29?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Globalization.CompareInfo.IndexOf%28System.String%2CSystem.Char%29?displayProperty=fullName> methods when searching for an individual character. The ligature \"æ\" (U+00E6) is found in the string \"aerial\" when using the conventions of the en-US culture, but not when using the conventions of the da-DK culture or when performing an ordinal comparison.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.String.Class#22](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cs/search1.cs#22)]\n [!code-vb[System.String.Class#22](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/vb/search1.vb#22)]  \n  \n On the other hand, <xref:System.String> class methods that search for a string rather than a character perform a culture-sensitive search if search options are not explicitly specified by a parameter of type <xref:System.StringComparison>. The sole exception is <xref:System.String.Contains%2A>, which performs an ordinal search.  \n  \n<a name=\"equality\"></a>   \n### Testing for equality  \n Use the <xref:System.String.Compare%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method to determine the relationship of two strings in the sort order. Typically, this is a culture-sensitive operation. In contrast, call the <xref:System.String.Equals%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method to test for equality. Because the test for equality usually compares user input with some known string, such as a valid user name, a password, or a file system path, it is typically an ordinal operation.  \n  \n> [!WARNING]\n>  It is possible to test for equality by calling the <xref:System.String.Compare%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method and determining whether the return value is zero. However, this practice is not recommended. To determine whether two strings are equal, you should call one of the overloads of the <xref:System.String.Equals%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method. The preferred overload to call is either the instance <xref:System.String.Equals%28System.String%2CSystem.StringComparison%29> method or the static <xref:System.String.Equals%28System.String%2CSystem.String%2CSystem.StringComparison%29> method, because both methods include a <xref:System.StringComparison?displayProperty=fullName> parameter that explicitly specifies the type of comparison.  \n  \n The following example illustrates the danger of performing a culture-sensitive comparison for equality when an ordinal one should be used instead. In this case, the intent of the code is to prohibit file system access from URLs that begin with \"FILE://\" or \"file://\" by performing a case-insensitive comparison of the beginning of a URL with the string \"FILE://\". However, if a culture-sensitive comparison is performed using the Turkish (Turkey) culture on a URL that begins with \"file://\", the comparison for equality fails, because the Turkish uppercase equivalent of the lowercase \"i\" is \"İ\" instead of \"I\". As a result, file system access is inadvertently permitted. On the other hand, if an ordinal comparison is performed, the comparison for equality succeeds, and file system access is denied.  \n  \n [!code-cpp[System.String.Class#11](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cpp/string.equals.cpp#11)]\n [!code-csharp[System.String.Class#11](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cs/equality1.cs#11)]\n [!code-vb[System.String.Class#11](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/vb/equality1.vb#11)]  \n  \n<a name=\"Normalization\"></a>   \n## Normalization  \n Some Unicode characters have multiple representations. For example, any of the following code points can represent the letter \"ắ\":  \n  \n-   U+1EAF  \n  \n-   U+0103 U+0301  \n  \n-   U+0061 U+0306 U+0301  \n  \n Multiple representations for a single character complicate searching, sorting, matching, and other string operations.  \n  \n The Unicode standard defines a process called normalization that returns one binary representation of a Unicode character for any of its equivalent binary representations. Normalization can use several algorithms, called normalization forms, that follow different rules. The .NET Framework supports Unicode normalization forms C, D, KC, and KD. When strings have been normalized to the same normalization form, they can be compared by using ordinal comparison.  \n  \n An ordinal comparison is a binary comparison of the Unicode scalar value of corresponding <xref:System.Char> objects in each string. The<xref:System.String> class includes a number of methods that can perform an ordinal comparison, including the following:  \n  \n-   Any overload of the <xref:System.String.Compare%2A>, <xref:System.String.Equals%2A>, <xref:System.String.StartsWith%2A>,  <xref:System.String.EndsWith%2A>, <xref:System.String.IndexOf%2A>,and <xref:System.String.LastIndexOf%2A> methods that includes a <xref:System.StringComparison> parameter. The method performs an ordinal comparison if you supply a value of <xref:System.StringComparison?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase> for this parameter.  \n  \n-   The overloads of the <xref:System.String.CompareOrdinal%2A> method.  \n  \n-   Methods that use ordinal comparison by default, such as <xref:System.String.Contains%2A>, <xref:System.String.Replace%2A>, and <xref:System.String.Split%2A>.  \n  \n-   Methods that search for a <xref:System.Char>value or for the elements in a <xref:System.Char> arrayin a string instance. Such methods include <xref:System.String.IndexOf%28System.Char%29> and <xref:System.String.Split%28System.Char%5B%5D%29>.  \n  \n You can determine whether a string is normalized to normalization form C by calling the <xref:System.String.IsNormalized?displayProperty=fullName> method, or you can call the <xref:System.String.IsNormalized%28System.Text.NormalizationForm%29?displayProperty=fullName> method to determine whether a string is normalized to a specified normalization form. You can also call the <xref:System.String.Normalize?displayProperty=fullName> method to convert a string to normalization form C, or you can call the <xref:System.String.Normalize%28System.Text.NormalizationForm%29?displayProperty=fullName> method to convert a string to a specified normalization form. For step-by-step information about normalizing and comparing strings, see the <xref:System.String.Normalize> and <xref:System.String.Normalize%28System.Text.NormalizationForm%29> methods.  \n  \n The following simple example illustrates string normalization. It defines the letter \"ố\" in three different ways in three different strings, and uses an ordinal comparison for equality to determine that each string differs from the other two strings. It then converts each string to the supported normalization forms, and again performs an ordinal comparison of each string in a specified normalization form. In each case, the second test for equality shows that the strings are equal.  \n  \n [!code-cpp[System.String.Class#14](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cpp/string.normalize.cpp#14)]\n [!code-csharp[System.String.Class#14](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cs/normalize1.cs#14)]\n [!code-vb[System.String.Class#14](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/vb/normalize1.vb#14)]  \n  \n For more information about normalization and normalization forms, see <xref:System.Text.NormalizationForm?displayProperty=fullName>, as well as [Unicode Standard Annex #15: Unicode Normalization Forms](http://unicode.org/reports/tr15/) and the [Normalization FAQ](http://www.unicode.org/faq/normalization.html) on the unicode.org website.  \n  \n<a name=\"ByCategory\"></a>   \n## String operations by category  \n The <xref:System.String> class provides members for comparing strings, testing strings for equality, finding characters or substrings in a string, modifying a string, extracting substrings from a string, combining strings, formatting values, copying a string, and normalizing a string.  \n  \n### Comparing strings  \n You can compare strings to determine their relative position in the sort order by using the following <xref:System.String>methods:  \n  \n-   <xref:System.String.Compare%2A> returns an integer that indicates the relationship of one string to a second string in the sort order.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.String.CompareOrdinal%2A> returns an integer that indicates the relationship of one string to a second string based on a comparison of their code points.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.String.CompareTo%2A> returns an integer that indicates the relationship of the current string instance to a second string in the sort order. The <xref:System.String.CompareTo%28System.String%29> method provides the <xref:System.IComparable> and <xref:System.IComparable%601> implementations for the <xref:System.String> class.  \n  \n### Testing strings for equality  \n You call the <xref:System.String.Equals%2A> method to determine whether two strings are equal. The instance <xref:System.String.Equals%28System.String%2CSystem.String%2CSystem.StringComparison%29> and the static <xref:System.String.Equals%28System.String%2CSystem.StringComparison%29> overloads let you specify whether the comparison is culture-sensitive or ordinal, and whether case is considered or ignored. Most tests for equality are ordinal, and comparisons for equality that determine access to a system resource (such as a file system object) should always be ordinal.  \n  \n### Finding characters in a string  \n The <xref:System.String> class includes two kinds of search methods:  \n  \n-   Methods that return a <xref:System.Boolean> value to indicate whether a particular substring is present in a string instance. These include the <xref:System.String.Contains%2A>, <xref:System.String.EndsWith%2A>, and <xref:System.String.StartsWith%2A> methods.  \n  \n-   Methods that indicate the starting position of a substring in a string instance. These include the <xref:System.String.IndexOf%2A>, <xref:System.String.IndexOfAny%2A>, <xref:System.String.LastIndexOf%2A>, and <xref:System.String.LastIndexOfAny%2A> methods.  \n  \n> [!WARNING]\n>  If you want to search a string for a particular pattern rather than a specific substring, you should use regular expressions. For more information, see [.NET Framework Regular Expressions](~/docs/standard/base-types/regular-expressions.md).  \n  \n### Modifying a string  \n The <xref:System.String> class includes the following methods that appear to modify the value of a string:  \n  \n-   <xref:System.String.Insert%2A> inserts a string into the current <xref:System.String> instance.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.String.PadLeft%2A> inserts one or more occurrences of a specified character at the beginning of a string.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.String.PadRight%2A> inserts one or more occurrences of a specified character at the beginning of a string.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.String.Remove%2A> deletes a substring from the current <xref:System.String> instance.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.String.Replace%2A> replaces a substring with another substring in the current <xref:System.String> instance.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.String.ToLower%2A> and <xref:System.String.ToLowerInvariant%2A> convert all the characters in a string to lowercase.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.String.ToUpper%2A> and <xref:System.String.ToUpperInvariant%2A> convert all the characters in a string to uppercase.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.String.Trim%2A> removes all occurrences of a character from the beginning and end of a string.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.String.TrimEnd%2A> removes all occurrences of a character from the end of a string.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.String.TrimStart%2A> removes all occurrences of a character from the beginning of a string.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  All string modification methods return a new <xref:System.String> object. They do not modify the value of the current instance.  \n  \n### Extracting substrings from a string  \n The <xref:System.String.Split%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method separates a single string into multiple strings. Overloads of the method allow you to specify multiple delimiters, to determine the maximum number of substrings that the method extracts, and to determine whether empty strings (which occur when delimiters are adjacent) are included among the returned strings.  \n  \n### Combining strings  \n The following <xref:System.String> methods can be used for string concatenation:  \n  \n-   <xref:System.String.Concat%2A> combines one or more substrings into a single string.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.String.Join%2A> concatenates one or more substrings into a single element and adds a separator between each substring.  \n  \n### Formatting values  \n The <xref:System.String.Format%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method uses the composite formatting feature to replace one or more placeholders in a string with the string representation of some object or value. The <xref:System.String.Format%2A> method is often used to do the following:  \n  \n-   To embed the string representation of a numeric value in a string.  \n  \n-   To embed the string representation of a date and time value in a string.  \n  \n-   To embed the string representation of an enumeration value in a string.  \n  \n-   To embed the string representation of some object that supports the <xref:System.IFormattable> interface in a string.  \n  \n-   To right-justify or left-justify a substring in a field within a larger string.  \n  \n For detailed information about formatting operations and examples, see the <xref:System.String.Format%2A> overload summary.  \n  \n### Copying a string  \n You can call the following <xref:System.String> methods to make a copy of a string:  \n  \n-   <xref:System.String.Clone%2A> returns a reference to an existing <xref:System.String> object.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.String.Copy%2A> creates a copy of an existing string.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.String.CopyTo%2A> copies a portion of a string to a character array.  \n  \n### Normalizing a string  \n In Unicode, a single character can have multiple code points. Normalization converts these equivalent characters into the same binary representation. The <xref:System.String.Normalize%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method performs the normalization, and the <xref:System.String.IsNormalized%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method determines whether a string is normalized.  \n  \n For more information and an example, see the [Normalization](#Normalization) section earlier in this topic.","nodes":[{"pos":[2,405],"content":"[!NOTE]\n To view the .NET Framework source code for this type, see the [Reference Source](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/string.cs#8281103e6f23cb5c).

First, the memory allocated for interned <xref:System.String> objects is not likely be released until the common language runtime (CLR) terminates. The reason is that the CLR's reference to the interned <xref:System.String> object can persist after your application, or even your application domain, terminates. Second, to intern a string, you must first create the string. The memory used by the <xref:System.String> object must still be allocated, even though the memory will eventually be garbage collected.  \n  \n The .NET Framework version 2.0 introduces the <xref:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.CompilationRelaxations?displayProperty=fullName>enumeration member. The <xref:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.CompilationRelaxations.NoStringInterning> member marks an assembly as not requiring string-literal interning.

Also, when you use the [Ngen.exe (Native Image Generator)](~/docs/framework/tools/ngen-exe-native-image-generator.md) to compile an assembly in advance of run time, strings are not interned across modules.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,319],"content":"The common language runtime conserves string storage by maintaining a table, called the intern pool, that contains a single reference to each unique literal string declared or created programmatically in your program.

If the `separator` parameter is `null` or contains no characters, white-space characters are assumed to be the delimiters. White-space characters are defined by the Unicode standard and return `true` if they are passed to the <xref:System.Char.IsWhiteSpace%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method. However, if the `separator` parameter in the call to this method overload is `null`, compiler overload resolution fails. To unambiguously identify the called method, your code must indicate the type of the `null`. The following example shows several ways to unambiguously identify this overload.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.String.Split#4](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Split/cs/split3.cs#4)]\n [!code-vb[System.String.Split#4](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Split/vb/split3.vb#4)]  \n  \n If the `count` parameter is zero, or the `options` parameter is <xref:System.StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries> and the length of this instance is zero, an empty array is returned.  \n  \n Each element of `separator` defines a separate delimiter that consists of one or more characters. If the `options` parameter is <xref:System.StringSplitOptions.None>, and two delimiters are adjacent or a delimiter is found at the beginning or end of this instance, the corresponding array element contains <xref:System.String.Empty>.  \n  \n If there are more than `count` substrings in this instance, the first `count` minus 1 substrings are returned in the first `count` minus 1 elements of the return value, and the remaining characters in this instance are returned in the last element of the return value.  \n  \n If `count` is greater than the number of substrings, the available substrings are returned and no exception is thrown.  \n  \n## The separator array  \n If any of the elements in `separator` consists of multiple characters, the entire substring is considered a delimiter. For example, if one of the elements in `separator` is \"10\", attempting to split the string \"This10is10a10string.\" returns this four-element array: { \"This\", \"is\", \"a\", \"string.\" }.  \n  \n## Comparison details  \n The <xref:System.String.Split%2A> method extracts the substrings in this string that are delimited by one or more of the strings in the `separator` parameter, and returns those substrings as elements of an array.  \n  \n The <xref:System.String.Split%2A> method looks for delimiters by performing comparisons using case-sensitive ordinal sort rules. For more information about word, string, and ordinal sorts, see the <xref:System.Globalization.CompareOptions?displayProperty=fullName> enumeration.  \n  \n The <xref:System.String.Split%2A> method ignores any element of `separator` whose value is `null` or the empty string (\"\").  \n  \n To avoid ambiguous results when strings in `separator` have characters in common, the <xref:System.String.Split%2A> method proceeds from the beginning to the end of the value of the instance, and matches the first element in `separator` that is equal to a delimiter in the instance. The order in which substrings are encountered in the instance takes precedence over the order of elements in `separator`.  \n  \n For example, consider an instance whose value is \"abcdef\". If the first element in `separator` was \"ef\" and the second element was \"bcde\", the result of the split operation would be \"a\" and \"f\". This is because the substring in the instance, \"bcde\", is encountered and matches an element in `separator` before the substring \"f\" is encountered.  \n  \n However, if the first element of `separator` was \"bcd\" and the second element was \"bc\", the result of the split operation would be \"a\" and \"ef\". This is because \"bcd\" is the first delimiter in `separator` that matches a delimiter in the instance. If the order of the separators was reversed so the first element was \"bc\" and the second element was \"bcd\", the result would be \"a\" and \"def\".  \n  \n## Performance considerations  \n The<xref:System.String.Split%2A> methods allocate memory for the returned array object and a <xref:System.String> object for each array element. If your application requires optimal performance or if managing memory allocation is critical in your application, consider using the <xref:System.String.IndexOf%2A> or <xref:System.String.IndexOfAny%2A> method, and optionally the <xref:System.String.Compare%2A> method, to locate a substring within a string.  \n  \n If you are splitting a string at a separator character, use the <xref:System.String.IndexOf%2A> or <xref:System.String.IndexOfAny%2A> method to locate a separator character in the string. If you are splitting a string at a separator string, use the <xref:System.String.IndexOf%2A> or <xref:System.String.IndexOfAny%2A> method to locate the first character of the separator string. Then use the <xref:System.String.Compare%2A> method to determine whether the characters after that first character are equal to the remaining characters of the separator string.  \n  \n In addition, if the same set of characters is used to split strings in multiple <xref:System.String.Split%2A> method calls, consider creating a single array and referencing it in each method call. This significantly reduces the additional overhead of each method call.","nodes":[{"pos":[3,23],"content":"Return value details","linkify":"Return value details","nodes":[{"content":"Return value details","pos":[0,20]}]},{"pos":[27,100],"content":"Delimiter strings are not included in the elements of the returned array.","nodes":[{"content":"Delimiter strings are not included in the elements of the returned array.","pos":[0,73]}]},{"pos":[107,873],"content":"If this instance does not contain any of the strings in `separator`, or the `count` parameter is 1, the returned array consists of a single element that contains this instance.

For example, if the `separator` array includes the string \"--\" and the value of the current string instance is \"aa--bb-cc\", the method returns an array that contains three elements: \"aa\", \"bb\", and \"cc\".  \n  \n If this instance does not contain any of the strings in `separator`, the returned array consists of a single element that contains this instance.  \n  \n If the `options` parameter is <xref:System.StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries> and the length of this instance is zero, the method returns an empty array.  \n  \n Each element of `separator` defines a separate delimiter that consists of one or more characters. If the `options` argument is <xref:System.StringSplitOptions.None>, and two delimiters are adjacent or a delimiter is found at the beginning or end of this instance, the corresponding array element contains <xref:System.String?displayProperty=fullName>. For example, if `separator` includes  two elements, \"-\" and \"_\", the value of the string instance is \"-_aa-\\_\", and the value of   the `options` argument is <xref:System.StringSplitOptions.None>, the method returns a sting array with the following five elements:  \n  \n1.  <xref:System.String.Empty?displayProperty=fullName>, which represents the empty string that precedes the \"-\" substring at index 0.  \n  \n2.  <xref:System.String.Empty?displayProperty=fullName>, which represents the empty string between the \"-\" substring at index 0 and the \"_\" substring at index 1.  \n  \n3.  \"aa\",  \n  \n4.  <xref:System.String.Empty?displayProperty=fullName>, which represents the empty string that follows the \"_\" substring at index 4.  \n  \n5.  <xref:System.String.Empty?displayProperty=fullName>, which represents the empty string that follows the \"-\" substring at index 5.  \n  \n## The separator array  \n If any of the elements in `separator` consists of multiple characters, the entire substring is considered a delimiter. For example, if one of the elements in `separator` is \"10\", attempting to split the string \"This10is10a10string.\" returns the following four-element array: { \"This\", \"is\", \"a\", \"string.\" }.  \n  \n If the `separator` parameter is `null` or contains no characters, white-space characters are assumed to be the delimiters. White-space characters are defined by the Unicode standard and return `true` if they are passed to the <xref:System.Char.IsWhiteSpace%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method.  \n  \n If the `separator` parameter in the call to this method overload is `null`, compiler overload resolution fails.

For more information about word, string, and ordinal sorts, see the <xref:System.Globalization.CompareOptions?displayProperty=fullName> enumeration.  \n  \n The <xref:System.String.Split%2A> method ignores any element of `separator` whose value is `null` or the empty string (\"\").  \n  \n To avoid ambiguous results when strings in `separator` have characters in common, the <xref:System.String.Split%2A> operation proceeds from the beginning to the end of the value of the instance, and matches the first element in `separator` that is equal to a delimiter in the instance. The order in which substrings are encountered in the instance takes precedence over the order of elements in `separator`.  \n  \n For example, consider an instance whose value is \"abcdef\". If the first element in `separator` was \"ef\" and the second element was \"bcde\", the result of the split operation would be a string array that contains two elements, \"a\" and \"f\". This is because the substring in the instance, \"bcde\", is encountered and matches an element in `separator` before the substring \"f\" is encountered.  \n  \n However, if the first element of `separator` was \"bcd\" and the second element was \"bc\", the result of the split operation would be a string array that contains two elements, \"a\" and \"ef\". This is because \"bcd\" is the first delimiter in `separator` that matches a delimiter in the instance. If the order of the separators was reversed so the first element was \"bc\" and the second element was \"bcd\", the result would be a string array that contains two elements,  \"a\" and \"def\".  \n  \n## Performance considerations  \n The <xref:System.String.Split%2A> methods allocate memory for the returned array object and a <xref:System.String> object for each array element. If your application requires optimal performance or if managing memory allocation is critical in your application, consider using the <xref:System.String.IndexOf%2A> or <xref:System.String.IndexOfAny%2A> method, and optionally the <xref:System.String.Compare%2A> method, to locate a substring within a string.  \n  \n If you are splitting a string at a separator character, use the <xref:System.String.IndexOf%2A> or <xref:System.String.IndexOfAny%2A> method to locate a separator character in the string.

Then use the <xref:System.String.Compare%2A> method to determine whether the characters after that first character are equal to the remaining characters of the separator string.  \n  \n In addition, if the same set of characters is used to split strings in multiple <xref:System.String.Split%2A> method calls, consider creating a single array and referencing it in each method call. This significantly reduces the additional overhead of each method call.","nodes":[{"pos":[3,23],"content":"Return value details","linkify":"Return value details","nodes":[{"content":"Return value details","pos":[0,20]}]},{"pos":[27,350],"content":"Delimiter characters (the characters in the `separator` array) are not included in the elements of the returned array.

For other ways to extract substrings from a string, see the [Alternatives to String.Split](#Alternatives) section.  \n  \n## Return value details  \n Delimiter characters are not included in the elements of the returned array. For example, if the separator array includes the character \"-\" and the value of the current string instance is \"aa-bb-cc\", the method returns an array that contains three elements: \"aa\", \"bb\", and \"cc\".  \n  \n If this instance does not contain any of the characters in `separator`, the returned array consists of a single element that contains this instance.  \n  \n Each element of `separator` defines a separate delimiter character. If two delimiters are adjacent, or a delimiter is found at the beginning or end of this instance, the corresponding element in the returned array contains <xref:System.String.Empty>. Here are some examples:  \n  \n|String value|Separator|Returned array|  \n|------------------|---------------|--------------------|  \n|\"42, 12, 19\"|new Char[] {',', ' '} (C#)<br /><br /> Char() = {\",\"c, \" \"c}) (Visual Basic)|{\"42\", \"\", \"12\", \"\", \"19\"}|  \n|\"42..12..19\"|new Char[] {'.'} (C#)<br /><br /> Char() = {\".\"c} (Visual Basic)|{\"42\", \"\", \"12\", \"\", \"19\"}|  \n|\"Banana\"|new Char[] {'.'} (C#)<br /><br /> Char() = {\".\"c} (Visual Basic)|{\"Banana\"}|  \n|\"Darb\\nSmarba\" (C#)<br /><br /> \"Darb\" & vbLf & \"Smarba\" (Visual Basic)|new Char[] {} (C#)<br /><br /> Char() = {} (Visual Basic)|{\"Darb\", \"Smarba\"}|  \n|\"Darb\\nSmarba\" (C#)<br /><br /> \"Darb\" & vbLf & \"Smarba\" (Visual Basic)|null (C#)<br /><br /> Nothing (Visual Basic)|{\"Darb\", \"Smarba\"}|  \n  \n## The separator array  \n Each element of separator defines a separate delimiter that consists of a single character. If the `separator` argument is `null` or contains no characters, the method treats white-space characters as the delimiters. White-space characters are defined by the Unicode standard; they return `true` if they are passed to the <xref:System.Char.IsWhiteSpace%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method.  \n  \n## String.Split(Char[]) and compiler overload resolution  \n Although the single parameter for this overload of <xref:System.String.Split%2A?displayProperty=fullName> is a character array, you can call it with a single character, as the following example shows.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.String.Split#12](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Split/cs/Split_CompilerResolution1.cs#12)]\n [!code-vb[System.String.Split#12](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Split/vb/Split_CompilerResolution1.vb#12)]  \n  \n Because the `separator` parameter is decorated  with the <xref:System.ParamArrayAttribute> attribute, compilers will interpret a single character as a single-element character array. This is not the case for other <xref:System.String.Split%2A?displayProperty=fullName> overloads that include a `separator` parameter; you must explicitly pass these overloads a character array as the `separator` argument.  \n  \n## Comparison details  \n The <xref:System.String.Split%28System.Char%5B%5D%29> method extracts the substrings in this string that are delimited by one or more of the characters in the `separator` array, and returns those substrings as elements of an array.  \n  \n The <xref:System.String.Split%28System.Char%5B%5D%29> method looks for delimiters by performing comparisons using case-sensitive ordinal sort rules. For more information about word, string, and ordinal sorts, see the <xref:System.Globalization.CompareOptions?displayProperty=fullName> enumeration.  \n  \n<a name=\"Alternatives\"></a>   \n## Alternatives to String.Split  \n The <xref:System.String.Split%2A> method is not always the best way to break a delimited string into substrings. If you don't want to extract all of the substrings of a delimited string, or if you want to parse a string based on a pattern instead of a set of delimiter characters, consider the following alternatives.  \n  \n### Regular expressions  \n If your strings conform to a fixed pattern, you can use a regular expression to extract and handle their elements. For example, if strings take the form \"*number* *operand* *number*\" you can use a [regular expression](~/docs/standard/base-types/regular-expressions.md) to extract and handle the string's elements. Here's an example:  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.String.Split#8](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Split/cs/splitalt1.cs#8)]\n [!code-vb[System.String.Split#8](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Split/vb/splitalt1.vb#8)]  \n  \n The regular expression pattern `(\\d+)\\s+([-+*/])\\s+(\\d+)` is defined like this:  \n  \n|Pattern|Description|  \n|-------------|-----------------|  \n|`(\\d+)`|Match one or more decimal digits. This is the first capturing group.|  \n|`\\s+`|Match one or more whitespace characters.|  \n|`([-+*/])`|Match an arithmetic operator sign (+, -, *, or /). This is the second capturing group.|  \n|`\\s+`|Match one or more whitespace characters.|  \n|`(\\d+)`|Match one or more decimal digits. This is the third capturing group.|  \n  \n You can also use a regular expression to extract substrings from a string based on a pattern rather than a fixed set of characters. This is a common scenario when either of these conditions occurs:  \n  \n-   One or more of the delimiter characters does not always serve as a delimiter in the <xref:System.String> instance.  \n  \n-   The sequence and number of delimiter characters is variable or unknown.  \n  \n For example, the <xref:System.String.Split%2A> method cannot be used to split the following string, because the number of `\\n` (in C#) or `vbCrLf` (in Visual Basic) characters is variable, and they do not always serve as delimiters.  \n  \n```  \n  \n[This is captured\\ntext.]\\n\\n[\\n[This is more captured text.]\\n]  \n\\n[Some more captured text:\\n   Option1\\n   Option2][Terse text.]  \n  \n```  \n  \n A regular expression can split this string easily, as the following example shows.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.String.Split#9](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Split/cs/splitalt2.cs#9)]\n [!code-vb[System.String.Split#9](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Split/vb/splitalt2.vb#9)]  \n  \n The regular expression pattern `\\[([^\\[\\]]+)\\]` is defined like this:  \n  \n|Pattern|Description|  \n|-------------|-----------------|  \n|`\\[`|Match an opening bracket.|  \n|`([^\\[\\]]+)`|Match any character that is not an opening or a closing bracket one or more times. This is the first capturing group.|  \n|`\\]`|Match a closing bracket.|  \n  \n The <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.Split%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method is almost identical to <xref:System.String.Split%2A?displayProperty=fullName>, except that it splits a string based on a regular expression pattern instead of a fixed character set. For example, the following example uses the <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.Split%2A?displayProperty=fullName>method to split a string that contains substrings delimited by various combinations of hyphens and other characters.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.String.Split#10](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Split/cs/splitalt3.cs#10)]\n [!code-vb[System.String.Split#10](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Split/vb/splitalt3.vb#10)]  \n  \n The regular expression pattern `\\s-\\s?[+*]?\\s?-\\s` is defined like this:  \n  \n|Pattern|Description|  \n|-------------|-----------------|  \n|`\\s-`|Match a whitespace character followed by a hyphen.|  \n|`\\s?`|Match zero or one whitespace character.|  \n|`[+*]?`|Match zero or one occurrence of either the + or * character.|  \n|`\\s?`|Match zero or one whitespace character.|  \n|`-\\s`|Match a hyphen followed by a whitespace character.|  \n  \n### Search methods and the Substring method  \n If you aren't interested in all of the substrings in a string, you might prefer to work with one of the string comparison methods that returns the index at which the match begins. You can then call the <xref:System.String.Substring%2A> method to extract the substring that you want. The string comparison methods include:  \n  \n-   <xref:System.String.IndexOf%2A>, which returns the zero-based index of the first occurrence of a character or string in a string instance.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.String.IndexOfAny%2A>, which returns the zero-based index in the current string instance of the first occurrence of any character in a character array.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.String.LastIndexOf%2A>, which returns the zero-based index of the last occurrence of a character or string in a string instance.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.String.LastIndexOfAny%2A>, which returns a zero-based index in the current string instance of the last occurrence of any character in a character array.  \n  \n The following example uses the <xref:System.String.IndexOf%2A> method to find the periods in a string. It then uses the <xref:System.String.Substring%2A> method to return full sentences.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.String.Split#11](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Split/cs/splitalt4.cs#11)]\n [!code-vb[System.String.Split#11](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Split/vb/splitalt4.vb#11)]  \n  \n## Performance Considerations  \n The<xref:System.String.Split%2A> methods allocate memory for the returned array object and a <xref:System.String> object for each array element. If your application requires optimal performance or if managing memory allocation is critical in your application, consider using the <xref:System.String.IndexOf%2A> or <xref:System.String.IndexOfAny%2A> method. You also have the option of using the <xref:System.String.Compare%2A> method to locate a substring within a string.  \n  \n To split a string at a separator character, use the <xref:System.String.IndexOf%2A> or <xref:System.String.IndexOfAny%2A> method to locate a separator character in the string. To split a string at a separator string, use the <xref:System.String.IndexOf%2A> or <xref:System.String.IndexOfAny%2A> method to locate the first character of the separator string. Then use the <xref:System.String.Compare%2A> method to determine whether the characters after that first character are equal to the remaining characters of the separator string.  \n  \n In addition, if the same set of characters is used to split strings in multiple <xref:System.String.Split%2A> method calls, consider creating a single array and referencing it in each method call.

This is the most commonly used method for creating a string. The following example uses assignment to create several strings.

For example, it is possible to create a string that has a low surrogate without a corresponding high surrogate. Although some methods, such as the methods of encoding and decoding objects in the <xref:System.Text> namespace, may performs checks to ensure that strings are well-formed, <xref:System.String> class members do not ensure that a string is well-formed.  \\n  \\n A single <xref:System.Char> object usually represents a single code point; that is, the numeric value of the <xref:System.Char> equals the code point. For example, the code point for the character \\\"a\\\" is U+0061. However, a code point might require more than one encoded element (more than one <xref:System.Char> object). The Unicode standard defines two types of characters that correspond to multiple <xref:System.Char> objects: graphemes, and Unicode supplementary code points that correspond to characters in the Unicode supplementary planes.  \\n  \\n-   A grapheme is represented by a base character followed by one or more combining characters. For example, the character ä is represented by a <xref:System.Char> object whose code point is U+0061 followed by a <xref:System.Char> object whose code point is U+0308. This character can also be defined by a single <xref:System.Char> object that has a code point of U+00E4. As the following example shows, a culture-sensitive comparison for equality indicates that these two representations are equal, although an ordinary ordinal comparison does not. However, if the two strings are normalized, an ordinal comparison also indicates that they are equal. (For more information on normalizing strings, see the [Normalization](#Normalization) section.)  \\n  \\n     [!code-cpp[System.String.Class#2](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cpp/string.char1.cpp#2)]\\n     [!code-csharp[System.String.Class#2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cs/grapheme1.cs#2)]\\n     [!code-vb[System.String.Class#2](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/vb/grapheme1.vb#2)]  \\n  \\n-   A Unicode supplementary code point (a surrogate pair) is represented by a <xref:System.Char> object whose code point is a high surrogate followed by a <xref:System.Char> object whose code point is a low surrogate.

Surrogate pairs are used to represent characters in the 16 Unicode supplementary planes.

However, in some languages such as C and C++, a null character indicates the end of a string;it is not considered a part of the string and is not counted as part of the string's length. This means that the following common assumptions that C and C++ programmers or libraries written in C or C++ might make about strings are not necessarily valid when applied to <xref:System.String> objects:  \\n  \\n-   The value returned by the `strlen` or `wcslen` functions does not necessarily equal <xref:System.String.Length%2A?displayProperty=fullName>.  \\n  \\n-   The string created by the `strcpy_s` or `wcscpy_s` functions is not necessarily identical to the string created by the <xref:System.String.Copy%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method.  \\n  \\n You should ensure that native C and C++ code that instantiates <xref:System.String> objects, and code that is passed <xref:System.String> objects through platform invoke, do not assume that an embedded null character marks the end of the string.  \\n  \\n Embedded null characters in a string are also treated differently when a string is sorted (or compared) and when a string is searched. Null characters are ignored when performing culture-sensitive comparisons between two strings, including comparisons using the invariant culture. They are considered only for ordinal or case-insensitive ordinal comparisons. On the other hand, embedded null characters are always considered when searching a string with methods such as <xref:System.String.Contains%2A>, <xref:System.String.StartsWith%2A>, and <xref:System.String.IndexOf%2A>.  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"Indexes\\\"></a>   \\n## Strings and indexes  \\n An index is the position of a <xref:System.Char> object (not a Unicode character) in a <xref:System.String>. An index is a zero-based, nonnegative number that starts from the first position in the string, which is index position zero. A number of search methods, such as <xref:System.String.IndexOf%2A> and <xref:System.String.LastIndexOf%2A>, return the index of a character or substring in the string instance.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.String.Chars%2A> property lets you access individual <xref:System.Char> objects by their index position in the string. Because the <xref:System.String.Chars%2A> property is the default property (in Visual Basic) or the indexer (in C#), you can access the individual <xref:System.Char> objects in a string by using code such as the following. This code looks for white space or punctuation characters in a string to determine how many words the string contains.  \\n  \\n [!code-cpp[System.String.Class#4](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cpp/string.index1.cpp#4)]\\n [!code-csharp[System.String.Class#4](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cs/index1.cs#4)]\\n [!code-vb[System.String.Class#4](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/vb/index1.vb#4)]  \\n  \\n Because the <xref:System.String> class implements the <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerable> interface, you can also iterate through the <xref:System.Char> objects in a string by using a `foreach` construct, as the following example shows.  \\n  \\n [!code-cpp[System.String.Class#5](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cpp/string.index2.cpp#5)]\\n [!code-csharp[System.String.Class#5](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cs/index2.cs#5)]\\n [!code-vb[System.String.Class#5](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/vb/index2.vb#5)]  \\n  \\n Consecutive index values might not correspond to consecutive Unicode characters, because a Unicode character might be encoded as more than one <xref:System.Char> object. In particular, a string may contain multi-character units of text that are formed by a base character followed by one or more combining characters or by surrogate pairs. To work with Unicode characters instead of <xref:System.Char> objects, use the <xref:System.Globalization.StringInfo?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Globalization.TextElementEnumerator> classes. The following example illustrates the difference between code that works with <xref:System.Char> objects and code that works with Unicode characters. It compares the number of characters or text elements in each word of a sentence. The string includes two sequences of a base character followed by a combining character.  \\n  \\n [!code-cpp[System.String.Class#6](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cpp/string.index3.cpp#6)]\\n [!code-csharp[System.String.Class#6](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cs/index3.cs#6)]\\n [!code-vb[System.String.Class#6](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/vb/index3.vb#6)]  \\n  \\n This example works with text elements by using the <xref:System.Globalization.StringInfo.GetTextElementEnumerator%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method and the <xref:System.Globalization.TextElementEnumerator> class to enumerate all the text elements in a string. You can also retrieve an array that contains the starting index of each text element by calling the <xref:System.Globalization.StringInfo.ParseCombiningCharacters%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method.  \\n  \\n For more information about working with units of text rather than individual <xref:System.Char> values, see the <xref:System.Globalization.StringInfo> class.  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"Nulls\\\"></a>   \\n## Null strings and empty strings  \\n A string that has been declared but has not been assigned a value is `null`. Attempting to call methods on that string throws a <xref:System.NullReferenceException>. A null string is different from an empty string, which is a string whose value is \\\"\\\" or <xref:System.String.Empty?displayProperty=fullName>. In some cases, passing either a null string or an empty string as an argument in a method call throws an exception. For example, passing a null string to the <xref:System.Int32.Parse%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method throws an <xref:System.ArgumentNullException>, and passing an empty string throws a <xref:System.FormatException>.

An ordinal operation acts on the numeric value of each <xref:System.Char> object. A culture-sensitive operation acts on the value of the <xref:System.String>object, and takes culture-specific casing, sorting, formatting, and parsing rules into account. Culture-sensitive operations execute in the context of an explicitly declared culture or the implicit current culture. The two kinds of operations can produce very different results when they are performed on the same string.  \\n  \\n The .NET Framework also supports culture-insensitive linguistic string operations by using the invariant culture (<xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName>), which is loosely based on the culture settings of the English language independent of region. Unlike other <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo?displayProperty=fullName> settings, the settings of the invariant culture are guaranteed to remain consistent on a single computer, from system to system, and across versions of the .NET Framework. The invariant culture can be seen as a kind of black box that ensures stability of string comparisons and ordering across all cultures.  \\n  \\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\n>  If your application makes a security decision about a symbolic identifier such as a file name or named pipe, or about persisted data such as the text-based data in an XML file, the operation should use an ordinal comparison instead of a culture-sensitive comparison. This is because a culture-sensitive comparison can yield different results depending on the culture in effect, whereas an ordinal comparison depends solely on the binary value of the compared characters.  \\n  \\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\n>  Most methods that perform string operations include an overload that has a parameter of type <xref:System.StringComparison>, which enables you to specify whether the method performs an ordinal or culture-sensitive operation. In general, you should call this overload to make the intent of your method call clear. For best practices and guidance for using ordinal and culture-sensitive operations on strings, see [Best Practices for Using Strings](~/docs/standard/base-types/best-practices-strings.md).  \\n  \\n Operations for [casing](#casing), [parsing and formatting](#parsing), [comparison and sorting](#comparison), and [testing for equality](#equality) can be either ordinal or culture-sensitive.

For example, instead of calling the <xref:System.String.Compare%28System.String%2CSystem.String%29> method to perform a culture-sensitive comparison of two strings by using the conventions of the current culture, you should call the <xref:System.String.Compare%28System.String%2CSystem.String%2CSystem.StringComparison%29> method with a value of <xref:System.StringComparison?displayProperty=fullName> for the `comparisonType` argument.

Often, a casing operation is performed before a string comparison. For example, a string might be converted to uppercase so that it can be compared with another uppercase string. You can convert the characters in a string to lowercase by calling the <xref:System.String.ToLower%2A> or <xref:System.String.ToLowerInvariant%2A> method, and you can convert them to uppercase by calling the <xref:System.String.ToUpper%2A> or <xref:System.String.ToUpperInvariant%2A> method. In addition, you can use the <xref:System.Globalization.TextInfo.ToTitleCase%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method to convert a string to title case.  \\n  \\n Casing operations can be based on the rules of the current culture, a specified culture, or the invariant culture. Because case mappings can vary depending on the culture used, the result of casing operations can vary based on culture. The actual differences in casing are of three kinds:  \\n  \\n-   Differences in the case mapping of LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I (U+0049), LATIN SMALL LETTER I (U+0069), LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH DOT ABOVE (U+0130), and LATIN SMALL LETTER DOTLESS I (U+0131). In the tr-TR (Turkish (Turkey)) and az-Latn-AZ (Azerbaijan, Latin) cultures, and in the tr, az, and az-Latn neutral cultures, the lowercase equivalent of LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I is LATIN SMALL LETTER DOTLESS I, and the uppercase equivalent of LATIN SMALL LETTER I is LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH DOT ABOVE. In all other cultures, including the invariant culture, LATIN SMALL LETTER I and LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I are lowercase and uppercase equivalents.  \\n  \\n     The following example demonstrates how a string comparison designed to prevent file system access can fail if it relies on a culture-sensitive casing comparison. (The casing conventions of the invariant culture should have been used.)  \\n  \\n     [!code-csharp[System.String.Class#17](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cs/case2.cs#17)]\\n     [!code-vb[System.String.Class#17](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/vb/case2.vb#17)]  \\n  \\n-   Differences in case mappings between the invariant culture and all other cultures.

In most cultures, a two-letter mixed-case pair is equal to the equivalent two-letter uppercase or lowercase pair. This is not true for the following two-letter pairs in the following cultures, because in each case they are compared to a digraph:  \\n  \\n    -   \\\"lJ\\\" and \\\"nJ\\\" in the hr-HR (Croatian (Croatia)) culture.  \\n  \\n    -   \\\"cH\\\" in the cs-CZ (Czech (Czech Republic)) and sk-SK (Slovak (Slovakia)) cultures.  \\n  \\n    -   \\\"aA\\\" in the da-DK (Danish (Denmark)) culture.  \\n  \\n    -   \\\"cS\\\", \\\"dZ\\\", \\\"dZS\\\", \\\"nY\\\", \\\"sZ\\\", \\\"tY\\\", and \\\"zS\\\" in the hu-HU (Hungarian (Hungary)) culture.  \\n  \\n    -   \\\"cH\\\" and \\\"lL\\\" in the es-ES_tradnl (Spanish (Spain, Traditional Sort)) culture.  \\n  \\n    -   \\\"cH\\\", \\\"gI\\\", \\\"kH\\\", \\\"nG\\\" \\\"nH\\\", \\\"pH\\\", \\\"qU', \\\"tH\\\", and \\\"tR\\\" in the vi-VN (Vietnamese (Vietnam)) culture.  \\n  \\n     However, it is unusual to encounter a situation in which a culture-sensitive comparison of these pairs creates problems, because these pairs are uncommon in fixed strings or identifiers.  \\n  \\n The following example illustrates some of the differences in casing rules between cultures when converting strings to uppercase.  \\n  \\n [!code-cpp[System.String.Class#7](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cpp/string.casing.cpp#7)]\\n [!code-csharp[System.String.Class#7](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cs/case1.cs#7)]\\n [!code-vb[System.String.Class#7](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/vb/case1.vb#7)]  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"parsing\\\"></a>   \\n### Parsing and formatting  \\n Formatting and parsing are inverse operations.

Both formatting and parsing rules are dependent on cultural conventions. The following example illustrates the ambiguity that can arise when interpreting a culture-specific date string. Without knowing the conventions of the culture that was used to produce a date string, it is not possible to know whether 03/01/2011, 3/1/2011, and 01/03/2011 represent January 3, 2011 or March 1, 2011.  \\n  \\n [!code-cpp[System.String.Class#8](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cpp/string.format1.cpp#8)]\\n [!code-csharp[System.String.Class#8](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cs/format1.cs#8)]\\n [!code-vb[System.String.Class#8](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/vb/format1.vb#8)]  \\n  \\n Similarly, as the following example shows, a single string can produce different dates depending on the culture whose conventions are used in the parsing operation.  \\n  \\n [!code-cpp[System.String.Class#9](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cpp/string.parse1.cpp#9)]\\n [!code-csharp[System.String.Class#9](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cs/parse1.cs#9)]\\n [!code-vb[System.String.Class#9](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/vb/parse1.vb#9)]  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"comparison\\\"></a>   \\n### String comparison and sorting  \\n Conventions for comparing and sorting strings vary from culture to culture. For example, the sort order may be based on phonetics or on the visual representation of characters. In East Asian languages, characters are sorted by the stroke and radical of ideographs. Sorting also depends on the order languages and cultures use for the alphabet. For example, the Danish language has an \\\"Æ\\\" character that it sorts after \\\"Z\\\" in the alphabet. In addition, comparisons can be case-sensitive or case-insensitive, and in some cases casing rules also differ by culture. Ordinal comparison, on the other hand, uses the Unicode code points of individual characters in a string when comparing and sorting strings.  \\n  \\n Sort rules determine the alphabetic order of Unicode characters and how two strings compare to each other. For example, the <xref:System.String.Compare%28System.String%2CSystem.String%2CSystem.StringComparison%29?displayProperty=fullName> method compares two strings based on the <xref:System.StringComparison> parameter. If the parameter value is <xref:System.StringComparison?displayProperty=fullName>, the method performs a linguistic comparison that uses the conventions of the current culture; if the parameter value is <xref:System.StringComparison?displayProperty=fullName>, the method performs an ordinal comparison. Consequently, as the following example shows, if the current culture is U.S. English, the first call to the <xref:System.String.Compare%28System.String%2CSystem.String%2CSystem.StringComparison%29?displayProperty=fullName> method (using culture-sensitive comparison) considers \\\"a\\\" less than \\\"A\\\", but the second call to the same method (using ordinal comparison) considers \\\"a\\\" greater than \\\"A\\\".  \\n  \\n [!code-cpp[System.String.Class#10](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cpp/string.compare1.cpp#10)]\\n [!code-csharp[System.String.Class#10](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cs/compare1.cs#10)]\\n [!code-vb[System.String.Class#10](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/vb/compare1.vb#10)]  \\n  \\n The .NET Framework supports word, string, and ordinal sort rules:  \\n  \\n-   A word sort performs a culture-sensitive comparison of strings in which certain nonalphanumeric Unicode characters might have special weights assigned to them. For example, the hyphen (-) might have a very small weight assigned to it so that \\\"coop\\\" and \\\"co-op\\\" appear next to each other in a sorted list. For a list of the <xref:System.String>methods that compare two strings using word sort rules, see the [String operations by category](#ByCategory) section.  \\n  \\n-   A string sort also performs a culture-sensitive comparison. It is similar to a word sort, except that there are no special cases, and all nonalphanumeric symbols come before all alphanumeric Unicode characters. Two strings can be compared using string sort rules by calling the <xref:System.Globalization.CompareInfo.Compare%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method overloads that have an `options` parameter that is supplied a value of <xref:System.Globalization.CompareOptions?displayProperty=fullName>. Note that this is the only method that the .NET Framework provides to compare two strings using string sort rules.  \\n  \\n-   An ordinal sort compares strings based on the numeric value of each <xref:System.Char> object in the string. An ordinal comparison is automatically case-sensitive because the lowercase and uppercase versions of a character have different code points. However, if case is not important, you can specify an ordinal comparison that ignores case. This is equivalent to converting the string to uppercase by using the invariant culture and then performing an ordinal comparison on the result. For a list of the <xref:System.String> methods that compare two strings using ordinal sort rules, see the [String operations by category](#ByCategory) section.  \\n  \\n A culture-sensitive comparison is any comparison that explicitly or implicitly uses a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object, including the invariant culture that is specified by the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property. The implicit culture is the current culture, which is specified by the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentCulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> properties. There is considerable variation in the sort order of alphabetic characters (that is, characters for which the <xref:System.Char.IsLetter%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property returns `true`) across cultures. You can specify a culture-sensitive comparison that uses the conventions of a specific culture by supplying a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object to a string comparison method such as <xref:System.String.Compare%28System.String%2CSystem.String%2CSystem.Globalization.CultureInfo%2CSystem.Globalization.CompareOptions%29>. You can specify a culture-sensitive comparison that uses the conventions of the current culture by supplying <xref:System.StringComparison?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.StringComparison?displayProperty=fullName>, or any member of the <xref:System.Globalization.CompareOptions> enumeration other than <xref:System.Globalization.CompareOptions?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.Globalization.CompareOptions?displayProperty=fullName> to an appropriate overload of the <xref:System.String.Compare%2A> method. A culture-sensitive comparison is generally appropriate for sorting whereas an ordinal comparison is not. An ordinal comparison is generally appropriate for determining whether two strings are equal (that is, for determining identity) whereas a culture-sensitive comparison is not.  \\n  \\n The following example illustrates the difference between culture-sensitive and ordinal comparison. The example evaluates three strings, \\\"Apple\\\", \\\"Æble\\\", and \\\"AEble\\\", using ordinal comparison and the conventions of the da-DK and en-US cultures (each of which is the default culture at the time the <xref:System.String.Compare%2A> method is called). Because the Danish language treats the character \\\"Æ\\\" as an individual letter and sorts it after \\\"Z\\\" in the alphabet, the string \\\"Æble\\\" is greater than \\\"Apple\\\". However, \\\"Æble\\\" is not considered equivalent to \\\"AEble\\\", so \\\"Æble\\\" is also greater than \\\"AEble\\\". The en-US culture doesn't include the letter\\\"Æ\\\" but treats it as equivalent to \\\"AE\\\", which explains why  \\\"Æble\\\" is less than \\\"Apple\\\" but equal to \\\"AEble\\\". Ordinal comparison, on the other hand, considers \\\"Apple\\\" to be less than \\\"Æble\\\", and \\\"Æble\\\" to be greater than \\\"AEble\\\".  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[System.String.Class#21](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cs/compare4.cs#21)]\\n [!code-vb[System.String.Class#21](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/vb/compare4.vb#21)]  \\n  \\n Use the following general guidelines to choose an appropriate sorting or string comparison method:  \\n  \\n-   If you want the strings to be ordered based on the user's culture, you should order them based on the conventions of the current culture. If the user's culture changes, the order of sorted strings will also change accordingly. For example, a thesaurus application should always sort words based on the user's culture.  \\n  \\n-   If you want the strings to be ordered based on the conventions of a specific culture, you should order them by supplying a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object that represents that culture to a comparison method. For example, in an application designed to teach students a particular language, you want strings to be ordered based on the conventions of one of the cultures that speaks that language.  \\n  \\n-   If you want the order of strings to remain unchanged across cultures, you should order them based on the conventions of the invariant culture or use an ordinal comparison. For example, you would use an ordinal sort to organize the names of files, processes, mutexes, or named pipes.  \\n  \\n-   For a comparison that involves a security decision (such as whether a username is valid), you should always perform an ordinal test for equality by calling an overload of the <xref:System.String.Equals%2A> method.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  The culture-sensitive sorting and casing rules used in string comparison depend on the version of the .NET Framework. In the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](~/includes/net-v45-md.md)] running on the [!INCLUDE[win8](~/includes/win8-md.md)] operating system, sorting, casing, normalization, and Unicode character information conforms to the Unicode 6.0 standard.

Instead, comparison methods are called by sorting methods such as <xref:System.Array.Sort%2A?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601.Sort%2A?displayProperty=fullName>. The following example performs four different sorting operations (word sort using the current culture, word sort using the invariant culture, ordinal sort, and string sort using the invariant culture) without explicitly calling a string comparison method, although they do specify the type of comparison to use. Note that each type of sort produces a unique ordering of strings in its array.  \\n  \\n [!code-cpp[System.String.Class#12](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cpp/string.compare2.cpp#12)]\\n [!code-csharp[System.String.Class#12](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cs/compare2.cs#12)]\\n [!code-vb[System.String.Class#12](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/vb/compare2.vb#12)]  \\n  \\n> [!TIP]\\n>  Internally, the.NET Framework uses sort keys to support culturallysensitive string comparison. Each character in a string is given several categories of sort weights, including alphabetic, case, and diacritic. A sort key, represented by the <xref:System.Globalization.SortKey> class, provides a repository of these weights for a particular string. If your app performs a large number of searching or sorting operations on the same set of strings, you can improve its performance by generating and storing sort keys for all the strings that it uses. When a sort or comparison operation is required, you use the sort keys instead of the strings. For more information, see the <xref:System.Globalization.SortKey> class.  \\n  \\n If you don't specify a string comparison convention, sorting methods such as <xref:System.Array.Sort%28System.Array%29?displayProperty=fullName> perform a culture-sensitive, case-sensitive sort on strings. The following example illustrates how changing the current culture affects the order of sorted strings in an array. It creates an array of three strings. First, it sets the `System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture` property to en-US and calls the <xref:System.Array.Sort%28System.Array%29?displayProperty=fullName> method. The resulting sort order is based on sorting conventions for the English (United States) culture. Next, the example sets the `System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture` property to da-DK and calls the <xref:System.Array.Sort%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method again.

To perform a culture-sensitive search for a character, you must call a <xref:System.Globalization.CompareInfo> method such as <xref:System.Globalization.CompareInfo.IndexOf%28System.String%2CSystem.Char%29?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.Globalization.CompareInfo.LastIndexOf%28System.String%2CSystem.Char%29?displayProperty=fullName>. Note that the results of searching for a character using ordinal and culture-sensitive comparison can be very different. For example, a search for a precomposed Unicode character such as the ligature \\\"Æ\\\" (U+00C6) might match any occurrence of its components in the correct sequence, such as \\\"AE\\\" (U+041U+0045), depending on the culture. The following example illustrates the difference between the <xref:System.String.IndexOf%28System.Char%29?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Globalization.CompareInfo.IndexOf%28System.String%2CSystem.Char%29?displayProperty=fullName> methods when searching for an individual character. The ligature \\\"æ\\\" (U+00E6) is found in the string \\\"aerial\\\" when using the conventions of the en-US culture, but not when using the conventions of the da-DK culture or when performing an ordinal comparison.  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[System.String.Class#22](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cs/search1.cs#22)]\\n [!code-vb[System.String.Class#22](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/vb/search1.vb#22)]  \\n  \\n On the other hand, <xref:System.String> class methods that search for a string rather than a character perform a culture-sensitive search if search options are not explicitly specified by a parameter of type <xref:System.StringComparison>. The sole exception is <xref:System.String.Contains%2A>, which performs an ordinal search.  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"equality\\\"></a>   \\n### Testing for equality  \\n Use the <xref:System.String.Compare%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method to determine the relationship of two strings in the sort order. Typically, this is a culture-sensitive operation. In contrast, call the <xref:System.String.Equals%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method to test for equality. Because the test for equality usually compares user input with some known string, such as a valid user name, a password, or a file system path, it is typically an ordinal operation.  \\n  \\n> [!WARNING]\\n>  It is possible to test for equality by calling the <xref:System.String.Compare%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method and determining whether the return value is zero. However, this practice is not recommended. To determine whether two strings are equal, you should call one of the overloads of the <xref:System.String.Equals%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method. The preferred overload to call is either the instance <xref:System.String.Equals%28System.String%2CSystem.StringComparison%29> method or the static <xref:System.String.Equals%28System.String%2CSystem.String%2CSystem.StringComparison%29> method, because both methods include a <xref:System.StringComparison?displayProperty=fullName> parameter that explicitly specifies the type of comparison.  \\n  \\n The following example illustrates the danger of performing a culture-sensitive comparison for equality when an ordinal one should be used instead. In this case, the intent of the code is to prohibit file system access from URLs that begin with \\\"FILE://\\\" or \\\"file://\\\" by performing a case-insensitive comparison of the beginning of a URL with the string \\\"FILE://\\\". However, if a culture-sensitive comparison is performed using the Turkish (Turkey) culture on a URL that begins with \\\"file://\\\", the comparison for equality fails, because the Turkish uppercase equivalent of the lowercase \\\"i\\\" is \\\"İ\\\" instead of \\\"I\\\". As a result, file system access is inadvertently permitted. On the other hand, if an ordinal comparison is performed, the comparison for equality succeeds, and file system access is denied.  \\n  \\n [!code-cpp[System.String.Class#11](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cpp/string.equals.cpp#11)]\\n [!code-csharp[System.String.Class#11](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cs/equality1.cs#11)]\\n [!code-vb[System.String.Class#11](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/vb/equality1.vb#11)]  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"Normalization\\\"></a>   \\n## Normalization  \\n Some Unicode characters have multiple representations. For example, any of the following code points can represent the letter \\\"ắ\\\":  \\n  \\n-   U+1EAF  \\n  \\n-   U+0103 U+0301  \\n  \\n-   U+0061 U+0306 U+0301  \\n  \\n Multiple representations for a single character complicate searching, sorting, matching, and other string operations.  \\n  \\n The Unicode standard defines a process called normalization that returns one binary representation of a Unicode character for any of its equivalent binary representations. Normalization can use several algorithms, called normalization forms, that follow different rules. The .NET Framework supports Unicode normalization forms C, D, KC, and KD. When strings have been normalized to the same normalization form, they can be compared by using ordinal comparison.  \\n  \\n An ordinal comparison is a binary comparison of the Unicode scalar value of corresponding <xref:System.Char> objects in each string. The<xref:System.String> class includes a number of methods that can perform an ordinal comparison, including the following:  \\n  \\n-   Any overload of the <xref:System.String.Compare%2A>, <xref:System.String.Equals%2A>, <xref:System.String.StartsWith%2A>,  <xref:System.String.EndsWith%2A>, <xref:System.String.IndexOf%2A>,and <xref:System.String.LastIndexOf%2A> methods that includes a <xref:System.StringComparison> parameter. The method performs an ordinal comparison if you supply a value of <xref:System.StringComparison?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase> for this parameter.  \\n  \\n-   The overloads of the <xref:System.String.CompareOrdinal%2A> method.  \\n  \\n-   Methods that use ordinal comparison by default, such as <xref:System.String.Contains%2A>, <xref:System.String.Replace%2A>, and <xref:System.String.Split%2A>.  \\n  \\n-   Methods that search for a <xref:System.Char>value or for the elements in a <xref:System.Char> arrayin a string instance. Such methods include <xref:System.String.IndexOf%28System.Char%29> and <xref:System.String.Split%28System.Char%5B%5D%29>.  \\n  \\n You can determine whether a string is normalized to normalization form C by calling the <xref:System.String.IsNormalized?displayProperty=fullName> method, or you can call the <xref:System.String.IsNormalized%28System.Text.NormalizationForm%29?displayProperty=fullName> method to determine whether a string is normalized to a specified normalization form. You can also call the <xref:System.String.Normalize?displayProperty=fullName> method to convert a string to normalization form C, or you can call the <xref:System.String.Normalize%28System.Text.NormalizationForm%29?displayProperty=fullName> method to convert a string to a specified normalization form. For step-by-step information about normalizing and comparing strings, see the <xref:System.String.Normalize> and <xref:System.String.Normalize%28System.Text.NormalizationForm%29> methods.  \\n  \\n The following simple example illustrates string normalization. It defines the letter \\\"ố\\\" in three different ways in three different strings, and uses an ordinal comparison for equality to determine that each string differs from the other two strings. It then converts each string to the supported normalization forms, and again performs an ordinal comparison of each string in a specified normalization form. In each case, the second test for equality shows that the strings are equal.  \\n  \\n [!code-cpp[System.String.Class#14](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cpp/string.normalize.cpp#14)]\\n [!code-csharp[System.String.Class#14](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/cs/normalize1.cs#14)]\\n [!code-vb[System.String.Class#14](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Class/vb/normalize1.vb#14)]  \\n  \\n For more information about normalization and normalization forms, see <xref:System.Text.NormalizationForm?displayProperty=fullName>, as well as [Unicode Standard Annex #15: Unicode Normalization Forms](http://unicode.org/reports/tr15/) and the [Normalization FAQ](http://www.unicode.org/faq/normalization.html) on the unicode.org website.  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"ByCategory\\\"></a>   \\n## String operations by category  \\n The <xref:System.String> class provides members for comparing strings, testing strings for equality, finding characters or substrings in a string, modifying a string, extracting substrings from a string, combining strings, formatting values, copying a string, and normalizing a string.  \\n  \\n### Comparing strings  \\n You can compare strings to determine their relative position in the sort order by using the following <xref:System.String>methods:  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.String.Compare%2A> returns an integer that indicates the relationship of one string to a second string in the sort order.  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.String.CompareOrdinal%2A> returns an integer that indicates the relationship of one string to a second string based on a comparison of their code points.  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.String.CompareTo%2A> returns an integer that indicates the relationship of the current string instance to a second string in the sort order. The <xref:System.String.CompareTo%28System.String%29> method provides the <xref:System.IComparable> and <xref:System.IComparable%601> implementations for the <xref:System.String> class.  \\n  \\n### Testing strings for equality  \\n You call the <xref:System.String.Equals%2A> method to determine whether two strings are equal. The instance <xref:System.String.Equals%28System.String%2CSystem.String%2CSystem.StringComparison%29> and the static <xref:System.String.Equals%28System.String%2CSystem.StringComparison%29> overloads let you specify whether the comparison is culture-sensitive or ordinal, and whether case is considered or ignored. Most tests for equality are ordinal, and comparisons for equality that determine access to a system resource (such as a file system object) should always be ordinal.  \\n  \\n### Finding characters in a string  \\n The <xref:System.String> class includes two kinds of search methods:  \\n  \\n-   Methods that return a <xref:System.Boolean> value to indicate whether a particular substring is present in a string instance. These include the <xref:System.String.Contains%2A>, <xref:System.String.EndsWith%2A>, and <xref:System.String.StartsWith%2A> methods.  \\n  \\n-   Methods that indicate the starting position of a substring in a string instance. These include the <xref:System.String.IndexOf%2A>, <xref:System.String.IndexOfAny%2A>, <xref:System.String.LastIndexOf%2A>, and <xref:System.String.LastIndexOfAny%2A> methods.  \\n  \\n> [!WARNING]\\n>  If you want to search a string for a particular pattern rather than a specific substring, you should use regular expressions. For more information, see [.NET Framework Regular Expressions](~/docs/standard/base-types/regular-expressions.md).  \\n  \\n### Modifying a string  \\n The <xref:System.String> class includes the following methods that appear to modify the value of a string:  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.String.Insert%2A> inserts a string into the current <xref:System.String> instance.  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.String.PadLeft%2A> inserts one or more occurrences of a specified character at the beginning of a string.  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.String.PadRight%2A> inserts one or more occurrences of a specified character at the beginning of a string.  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.String.Remove%2A> deletes a substring from the current <xref:System.String> instance.  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.String.Replace%2A> replaces a substring with another substring in the current <xref:System.String> instance.  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.String.ToLower%2A> and <xref:System.String.ToLowerInvariant%2A> convert all the characters in a string to lowercase.  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.String.ToUpper%2A> and <xref:System.String.ToUpperInvariant%2A> convert all the characters in a string to uppercase.  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.String.Trim%2A> removes all occurrences of a character from the beginning and end of a string.  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.String.TrimEnd%2A> removes all occurrences of a character from the end of a string.  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.String.TrimStart%2A> removes all occurrences of a character from the beginning of a string.  \\n  \\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\n>  All string modification methods return a new <xref:System.String> object. They do not modify the value of the current instance.  \\n  \\n### Extracting substrings from a string  \\n The <xref:System.String.Split%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method separates a single string into multiple strings. Overloads of the method allow you to specify multiple delimiters, to determine the maximum number of substrings that the method extracts, and to determine whether empty strings (which occur when delimiters are adjacent) are included among the returned strings.  \\n  \\n### Combining strings  \\n The following <xref:System.String> methods can be used for string concatenation:  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.String.Concat%2A> combines one or more substrings into a single string.  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.String.Join%2A> concatenates one or more substrings into a single element and adds a separator between each substring.  \\n  \\n### Formatting values  \\n The <xref:System.String.Format%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method uses the composite formatting feature to replace one or more placeholders in a string with the string representation of some object or value. The <xref:System.String.Format%2A> method is often used to do the following:  \\n  \\n-   To embed the string representation of a numeric value in a string.  \\n  \\n-   To embed the string representation of a date and time value in a string.  \\n  \\n-   To embed the string representation of an enumeration value in a string.  \\n  \\n-   To embed the string representation of some object that supports the <xref:System.IFormattable> interface in a string.  \\n  \\n-   To right-justify or left-justify a substring in a field within a larger string.  \\n  \\n For detailed information about formatting operations and examples, see the <xref:System.String.Format%2A> overload summary.  \\n  \\n### Copying a string  \\n You can call the following <xref:System.String> methods to make a copy of a string:  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.String.Clone%2A> returns a reference to an existing <xref:System.String> object.  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.String.Copy%2A> creates a copy of an existing string.  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.String.CopyTo%2A> copies a portion of a string to a character array.  \\n  \\n### Normalizing a string  \\n In Unicode, a single character can have multiple code points. Normalization converts these equivalent characters into the same binary representation. The <xref:System.String.Normalize%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method performs the normalization, and the <xref:System.String.IsNormalized%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method determines whether a string is normalized.  \\n  \\n For more information and an example, see the [Normalization](#Normalization) section earlier in this topic.\"\n  syntax:\n    content: >-\n      [System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComVisible(true)]\n\n      public sealed class String : ICloneable, IComparable, IComparable<string>, IConvertible, IEquatable<string>, System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<char>\n  inheritance:\n  -

Consequently, an instance of a literal string with a particular value only exists once in the system.  \\n  \\n For example, if you assign the same literal string to several variables, the runtime retrieves the same reference to the literal string from the intern pool and assigns it to each variable.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.String.Intern%2A> method uses the intern pool to search for a string equal to the value of `str`.

First, the memory allocated for interned <xref:System.String> objects is not likely be released until the common language runtime (CLR) terminates. The reason is that the CLR's reference to the interned <xref:System.String> object can persist after your application, or even your application domain, terminates. Second, to intern a string, you must first create the string. The memory used by the <xref:System.String> object must still be allocated, even though the memory will eventually be garbage collected.  \\n  \\n The .NET Framework version 2.0 introduces the <xref:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.CompilationRelaxations?displayProperty=fullName>enumeration member. The <xref:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.CompilationRelaxations.NoStringInterning> member marks an assembly as not requiring string-literal interning.

The .NET Framework currently supports normalization forms C, D, KC, and KD.  \\n  \\n For a description of supported Unicode normalization forms, see <xref:System.Text.NormalizationForm?displayProperty=fullName>.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following example demonstrates the <xref:System.String.IsNormalized%2A> and <xref:System.String.Normalize%2A> methods.  \\n  \\n [!code-cpp[string.normalize#1](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR/string.normalize/CPP/norm.cpp#1)]\\n [!code-csharp[string.normalize#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/string.normalize/CS/norm.cs#1)]\\n [!code-vb[string.normalize#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/string.normalize/VB/norm.vb#1)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public bool IsNormalized (System.Text.NormalizationForm normalizationForm);\n    parameters:\n    - id: normalizationForm\n      type: System.Text.NormalizationForm\n      description: A Unicode normalization form.\n    return:\n      type: System.Boolean\n      description: '`true` if this string is in the normalization form specified by the <code>normalizationForm</code> parameter; otherwise, `false`.'\n  overload: System.String.IsNormalized*\n  exceptions:\n  - type: System.ArgumentException\n    commentId: T:System.ArgumentException\n    description: The current instance contains invalid Unicode characters.\n  attributes: []\n  version:\n  - netcore-2.0\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  - netstandard-2.0\n  - xamarinandroid-7.1\n  - xamarinios-10.8\n  - xamarinmac-3.0\n  monikers:\n  - netcore-2.0\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  - netstandard-2.0\n  - xamarinandroid-7.1\n  - xamarinios-10.8\n  - xamarinmac-3.0\n  content_git_url: https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/xml/System/String.xml\n  ms.technology:\n  - dotnet-standard\n  author: rpetrusha\n  ms.author: ronpet\n  manager: wpickett\n- uid: System.String.IsNullOrEmpty(System.String)\n  commentId: M:System.String.IsNullOrEmpty(System.String)\n  id: IsNullOrEmpty(System.String)\n  parent: System.String\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: IsNullOrEmpty(String)\n  nameWithType: String.IsNullOrEmpty(String)\n  fullName: String.IsNullOrEmpty(String)\n  type: Method\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Runtime\n  - mscorlib\n  - netstandard\n  namespace: System\n  summary: Indicates whether the specified string is `null` or an <xref href=\"System.String.Empty\"></xref> string.\n  remarks: \"<xref:System.String.IsNullOrEmpty%2A> is a convenience method that enables you to simultaneously test whether a <xref:System.String> is `null` or its value is <xref:System.String.Empty>.

If the `separator` parameter is `null` or contains no characters, white-space characters are assumed to be the delimiters. White-space characters are defined by the Unicode standard and return `true` if they are passed to the <xref:System.Char.IsWhiteSpace%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method. However, if the `separator` parameter in the call to this method overload is `null`, compiler overload resolution fails. To unambiguously identify the called method, your code must indicate the type of the `null`. The following example shows several ways to unambiguously identify this overload.  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[System.String.Split#4](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Split/cs/split3.cs#4)]\\n [!code-vb[System.String.Split#4](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Split/vb/split3.vb#4)]  \\n  \\n If the `count` parameter is zero, or the `options` parameter is <xref:System.StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries> and the length of this instance is zero, an empty array is returned.  \\n  \\n Each element of `separator` defines a separate delimiter that consists of one or more characters. If the `options` parameter is <xref:System.StringSplitOptions.None>, and two delimiters are adjacent or a delimiter is found at the beginning or end of this instance, the corresponding array element contains <xref:System.String.Empty>.  \\n  \\n If there are more than `count` substrings in this instance, the first `count` minus 1 substrings are returned in the first `count` minus 1 elements of the return value, and the remaining characters in this instance are returned in the last element of the return value.  \\n  \\n If `count` is greater than the number of substrings, the available substrings are returned and no exception is thrown.  \\n  \\n## The separator array  \\n If any of the elements in `separator` consists of multiple characters, the entire substring is considered a delimiter. For example, if one of the elements in `separator` is \\\"10\\\", attempting to split the string \\\"This10is10a10string.\\\" returns this four-element array: { \\\"This\\\", \\\"is\\\", \\\"a\\\", \\\"string.\\\" }.  \\n  \\n## Comparison details  \\n The <xref:System.String.Split%2A> method extracts the substrings in this string that are delimited by one or more of the strings in the `separator` parameter, and returns those substrings as elements of an array.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.String.Split%2A> method looks for delimiters by performing comparisons using case-sensitive ordinal sort rules. For more information about word, string, and ordinal sorts, see the <xref:System.Globalization.CompareOptions?displayProperty=fullName> enumeration.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.String.Split%2A> method ignores any element of `separator` whose value is `null` or the empty string (\\\"\\\").  \\n  \\n To avoid ambiguous results when strings in `separator` have characters in common, the <xref:System.String.Split%2A> method proceeds from the beginning to the end of the value of the instance, and matches the first element in `separator` that is equal to a delimiter in the instance. The order in which substrings are encountered in the instance takes precedence over the order of elements in `separator`.  \\n  \\n For example, consider an instance whose value is \\\"abcdef\\\". If the first element in `separator` was \\\"ef\\\" and the second element was \\\"bcde\\\", the result of the split operation would be \\\"a\\\" and \\\"f\\\". This is because the substring in the instance, \\\"bcde\\\", is encountered and matches an element in `separator` before the substring \\\"f\\\" is encountered.  \\n  \\n However, if the first element of `separator` was \\\"bcd\\\" and the second element was \\\"bc\\\", the result of the split operation would be \\\"a\\\" and \\\"ef\\\". This is because \\\"bcd\\\" is the first delimiter in `separator` that matches a delimiter in the instance. If the order of the separators was reversed so the first element was \\\"bc\\\" and the second element was \\\"bcd\\\", the result would be \\\"a\\\" and \\\"def\\\".  \\n  \\n## Performance considerations  \\n The<xref:System.String.Split%2A> methods allocate memory for the returned array object and a <xref:System.String> object for each array element. If your application requires optimal performance or if managing memory allocation is critical in your application, consider using the <xref:System.String.IndexOf%2A> or <xref:System.String.IndexOfAny%2A> method, and optionally the <xref:System.String.Compare%2A> method, to locate a substring within a string.  \\n  \\n If you are splitting a string at a separator character, use the <xref:System.String.IndexOf%2A> or <xref:System.String.IndexOfAny%2A> method to locate a separator character in the string. If you are splitting a string at a separator string, use the <xref:System.String.IndexOf%2A> or <xref:System.String.IndexOfAny%2A> method to locate the first character of the separator string. Then use the <xref:System.String.Compare%2A> method to determine whether the characters after that first character are equal to the remaining characters of the separator string.  \\n  \\n In addition, if the same set of characters is used to split strings in multiple <xref:System.String.Split%2A> method calls, consider creating a single array and referencing it in each method call. This significantly reduces the additional overhead of each method call.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following example uses the <xref:System.StringSplitOptions> enumeration to include or exclude substrings generated by the <xref:System.String.Split%2A> method.  \\n  \\n [!code-cpp[string.split3#1](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR/string.split3/CPP/omit.cpp#1)]\\n [!code-csharp[string.split3#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/string.split3/CS/omit.cs#1)]\\n [!code-vb[string.split3#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/string.split3/VB/omit.vb#1)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: >-\n      [System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComVisible(false)]\n\n      public string[] Split (string[] separator, int count, StringSplitOptions options);\n    parameters:\n    - id: separator\n      type: System.String[]\n      description: A string array that delimits the substrings in this string, an empty array that contains no delimiters, or `null`.\n    - id: count\n      type: System.Int32\n      description: The maximum number of substrings to return.\n    - id: options\n      type: System.StringSplitOptions\n      description: <xref href=\"System.StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries\"></xref> to omit empty array elements from the array returned; or <xref href=\"System.StringSplitOptions.None\"></xref> to include empty array elements in the array returned.\n    return:\n      type: System.String[]\n      description: An array whose elements contain the substrings in this string that are delimited by one or more strings in <code>separator</code>.

You can specify whether the substrings include empty array elements.\n  remarks: \"When a string is delimited by a known set of strings, you can use the <xref:System.String.Split%2A> method to separate it into substrings.  \\n  \\n## Return value details  \\n Delimiter strings are not included in the elements of the returned array. For example, if the `separator` array includes the string \\\"--\\\" and the value of the current string instance is \\\"aa--bb-cc\\\", the method returns an array that contains three elements: \\\"aa\\\", \\\"bb\\\", and \\\"cc\\\".  \\n  \\n If this instance does not contain any of the strings in `separator`, the returned array consists of a single element that contains this instance.  \\n  \\n If the `options` parameter is <xref:System.StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries> and the length of this instance is zero, the method returns an empty array.  \\n  \\n Each element of `separator` defines a separate delimiter that consists of one or more characters. If the `options` argument is <xref:System.StringSplitOptions.None>, and two delimiters are adjacent or a delimiter is found at the beginning or end of this instance, the corresponding array element contains <xref:System.String?displayProperty=fullName>. For example, if `separator` includes  two elements, \\\"-\\\" and \\\"_\\\", the value of the string instance is \\\"-_aa-\\\\_\\\", and the value of   the `options` argument is <xref:System.StringSplitOptions.None>, the method returns a sting array with the following five elements:  \\n  \\n1.  <xref:System.String.Empty?displayProperty=fullName>, which represents the empty string that precedes the \\\"-\\\" substring at index 0.  \\n  \\n2.  <xref:System.String.Empty?displayProperty=fullName>, which represents the empty string between the \\\"-\\\" substring at index 0 and the \\\"_\\\" substring at index 1.  \\n  \\n3.  \\\"aa\\\",  \\n  \\n4.  <xref:System.String.Empty?displayProperty=fullName>, which represents the empty string that follows the \\\"_\\\" substring at index 4.  \\n  \\n5.  <xref:System.String.Empty?displayProperty=fullName>, which represents the empty string that follows the \\\"-\\\" substring at index 5.  \\n  \\n## The separator array  \\n If any of the elements in `separator` consists of multiple characters, the entire substring is considered a delimiter. For example, if one of the elements in `separator` is \\\"10\\\", attempting to split the string \\\"This10is10a10string.\\\" returns the following four-element array: { \\\"This\\\", \\\"is\\\", \\\"a\\\", \\\"string.\\\" }.  \\n  \\n If the `separator` parameter is `null` or contains no characters, white-space characters are assumed to be the delimiters. White-space characters are defined by the Unicode standard and return `true` if they are passed to the <xref:System.Char.IsWhiteSpace%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method.  \\n  \\n If the `separator` parameter in the call to this method overload is `null`, compiler overload resolution fails. To unambiguously identify the called method, your code must indicate the type of the `null`. The following example shows several ways to unambiguously identify this overload.  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[System.String.Split#6](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Split/cs/split3.cs#6)]\\n [!code-vb[System.String.Split#6](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Split/vb/split3.vb#6)]  \\n  \\n## Comparison details  \\n The <xref:System.String.Split%2A> method extracts the substrings in this string that are delimited by one or more of the strings in the `separator` parameter, and returns those substrings as elements of an array.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.String.Split%2A> method looks for delimiters by performing comparisons using case-sensitive ordinal sort rules. For more information about word, string, and ordinal sorts, see the <xref:System.Globalization.CompareOptions?displayProperty=fullName> enumeration.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.String.Split%2A> method ignores any element of `separator` whose value is `null` or the empty string (\\\"\\\").  \\n  \\n To avoid ambiguous results when strings in `separator` have characters in common, the <xref:System.String.Split%2A> operation proceeds from the beginning to the end of the value of the instance, and matches the first element in `separator` that is equal to a delimiter in the instance. The order in which substrings are encountered in the instance takes precedence over the order of elements in `separator`.  \\n  \\n For example, consider an instance whose value is \\\"abcdef\\\". If the first element in `separator` was \\\"ef\\\" and the second element was \\\"bcde\\\", the result of the split operation would be a string array that contains two elements, \\\"a\\\" and \\\"f\\\". This is because the substring in the instance, \\\"bcde\\\", is encountered and matches an element in `separator` before the substring \\\"f\\\" is encountered.  \\n  \\n However, if the first element of `separator` was \\\"bcd\\\" and the second element was \\\"bc\\\", the result of the split operation would be a string array that contains two elements, \\\"a\\\" and \\\"ef\\\". This is because \\\"bcd\\\" is the first delimiter in `separator` that matches a delimiter in the instance. If the order of the separators was reversed so the first element was \\\"bc\\\" and the second element was \\\"bcd\\\", the result would be a string array that contains two elements,  \\\"a\\\" and \\\"def\\\".  \\n  \\n## Performance considerations  \\n The <xref:System.String.Split%2A> methods allocate memory for the returned array object and a <xref:System.String> object for each array element.

For other ways to extract substrings from a string, see the [Alternatives to String.Split](#Alternatives) section.  \\n  \\n## Return value details  \\n Delimiter characters are not included in the elements of the returned array. For example, if the separator array includes the character \\\"-\\\" and the value of the current string instance is \\\"aa-bb-cc\\\", the method returns an array that contains three elements: \\\"aa\\\", \\\"bb\\\", and \\\"cc\\\".  \\n  \\n If this instance does not contain any of the characters in `separator`, the returned array consists of a single element that contains this instance.  \\n  \\n Each element of `separator` defines a separate delimiter character. If two delimiters are adjacent, or a delimiter is found at the beginning or end of this instance, the corresponding element in the returned array contains <xref:System.String.Empty>. Here are some examples:  \\n  \\n|String value|Separator|Returned array|  \\n|------------------|---------------|--------------------|  \\n|\\\"42, 12, 19\\\"|new Char[] {',', ' '} (C#)<br /><br /> Char() = {\\\",\\\"c, \\\" \\\"c}) (Visual Basic)|{\\\"42\\\", \\\"\\\", \\\"12\\\", \\\"\\\", \\\"19\\\"}|  \\n|\\\"42..12..19\\\"|new Char[] {'.'} (C#)<br /><br /> Char() = {\\\".\\\"c} (Visual Basic)|{\\\"42\\\", \\\"\\\", \\\"12\\\", \\\"\\\", \\\"19\\\"}|  \\n|\\\"Banana\\\"|new Char[] {'.'} (C#)<br /><br /> Char() = {\\\".\\\"c} (Visual Basic)|{\\\"Banana\\\"}|  \\n|\\\"Darb\\\\nSmarba\\\" (C#)<br /><br /> \\\"Darb\\\" & vbLf & \\\"Smarba\\\" (Visual Basic)|new Char[] {} (C#)<br /><br /> Char() = {} (Visual Basic)|{\\\"Darb\\\", \\\"Smarba\\\"}|  \\n|\\\"Darb\\\\nSmarba\\\" (C#)<br /><br /> \\\"Darb\\\" & vbLf & \\\"Smarba\\\" (Visual Basic)|null (C#)<br /><br /> Nothing (Visual Basic)|{\\\"Darb\\\", \\\"Smarba\\\"}|  \\n  \\n## The separator array  \\n Each element of separator defines a separate delimiter that consists of a single character. If the `separator` argument is `null` or contains no characters, the method treats white-space characters as the delimiters. White-space characters are defined by the Unicode standard; they return `true` if they are passed to the <xref:System.Char.IsWhiteSpace%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method.  \\n  \\n## String.Split(Char[]) and compiler overload resolution  \\n Although the single parameter for this overload of <xref:System.String.Split%2A?displayProperty=fullName> is a character array, you can call it with a single character, as the following example shows.  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[System.String.Split#12](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Split/cs/Split_CompilerResolution1.cs#12)]\\n [!code-vb[System.String.Split#12](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Split/vb/Split_CompilerResolution1.vb#12)]  \\n  \\n Because the `separator` parameter is decorated  with the <xref:System.ParamArrayAttribute> attribute, compilers will interpret a single character as a single-element character array. This is not the case for other <xref:System.String.Split%2A?displayProperty=fullName> overloads that include a `separator` parameter; you must explicitly pass these overloads a character array as the `separator` argument.  \\n  \\n## Comparison details  \\n The <xref:System.String.Split%28System.Char%5B%5D%29> method extracts the substrings in this string that are delimited by one or more of the characters in the `separator` array, and returns those substrings as elements of an array.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.String.Split%28System.Char%5B%5D%29> method looks for delimiters by performing comparisons using case-sensitive ordinal sort rules. For more information about word, string, and ordinal sorts, see the <xref:System.Globalization.CompareOptions?displayProperty=fullName> enumeration.  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"Alternatives\\\"></a>   \\n## Alternatives to String.Split  \\n The <xref:System.String.Split%2A> method is not always the best way to break a delimited string into substrings. If you don't want to extract all of the substrings of a delimited string, or if you want to parse a string based on a pattern instead of a set of delimiter characters, consider the following alternatives.  \\n  \\n### Regular expressions  \\n If your strings conform to a fixed pattern, you can use a regular expression to extract and handle their elements. For example, if strings take the form \\\"*number* *operand* *number*\\\" you can use a [regular expression](~/docs/standard/base-types/regular-expressions.md) to extract and handle the string's elements. Here's an example:  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[System.String.Split#8](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Split/cs/splitalt1.cs#8)]\\n [!code-vb[System.String.Split#8](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Split/vb/splitalt1.vb#8)]  \\n  \\n The regular expression pattern `(\\\\d+)\\\\s+([-+*/])\\\\s+(\\\\d+)` is defined like this:  \\n  \\n|Pattern|Description|  \\n|-------------|-----------------|  \\n|`(\\\\d+)`|Match one or more decimal digits. This is the first capturing group.|  \\n|`\\\\s+`|Match one or more whitespace characters.|  \\n|`([-+*/])`|Match an arithmetic operator sign (+, -, *, or /). This is the second capturing group.|  \\n|`\\\\s+`|Match one or more whitespace characters.|  \\n|`(\\\\d+)`|Match one or more decimal digits. This is the third capturing group.|  \\n  \\n You can also use a regular expression to extract substrings from a string based on a pattern rather than a fixed set of characters. This is a common scenario when either of these conditions occurs:  \\n  \\n-   One or more of the delimiter characters does not always serve as a delimiter in the <xref:System.String> instance.  \\n  \\n-   The sequence and number of delimiter characters is variable or unknown.  \\n  \\n For example, the <xref:System.String.Split%2A> method cannot be used to split the following string, because the number of `\\\\n` (in C#) or `vbCrLf` (in Visual Basic) characters is variable, and they do not always serve as delimiters.  \\n  \\n```  \\n  \\n[This is captured\\\\ntext.]\\\\n\\\\n[\\\\n[This is more captured text.]\\\\n]  \\n\\\\n[Some more captured text:\\\\n   Option1\\\\n   Option2][Terse text.]  \\n  \\n```  \\n  \\n A regular expression can split this string easily, as the following example shows.  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[System.String.Split#9](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Split/cs/splitalt2.cs#9)]\\n [!code-vb[System.String.Split#9](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Split/vb/splitalt2.vb#9)]  \\n  \\n The regular expression pattern `\\\\[([^\\\\[\\\\]]+)\\\\]` is defined like this:  \\n  \\n|Pattern|Description|  \\n|-------------|-----------------|  \\n|`\\\\[`|Match an opening bracket.|  \\n|`([^\\\\[\\\\]]+)`|Match any character that is not an opening or a closing bracket one or more times.

For example, the following example uses the <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.Split%2A?displayProperty=fullName>method to split a string that contains substrings delimited by various combinations of hyphens and other characters.  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[System.String.Split#10](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Split/cs/splitalt3.cs#10)]\\n [!code-vb[System.String.Split#10](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Split/vb/splitalt3.vb#10)]  \\n  \\n The regular expression pattern `\\\\s-\\\\s?[+*]?\\\\s?-\\\\s` is defined like this:  \\n  \\n|Pattern|Description|  \\n|-------------|-----------------|  \\n|`\\\\s-`|Match a whitespace character followed by a hyphen.|  \\n|`\\\\s?`|Match zero or one whitespace character.|  \\n|`[+*]?`|Match zero or one occurrence of either the + or * character.|  \\n|`\\\\s?`|Match zero or one whitespace character.|  \\n|`-\\\\s`|Match a hyphen followed by a whitespace character.|  \\n  \\n### Search methods and the Substring method  \\n If you aren't interested in all of the substrings in a string, you might prefer to work with one of the string comparison methods that returns the index at which the match begins. You can then call the <xref:System.String.Substring%2A> method to extract the substring that you want. The string comparison methods include:  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.String.IndexOf%2A>, which returns the zero-based index of the first occurrence of a character or string in a string instance.  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.String.IndexOfAny%2A>, which returns the zero-based index in the current string instance of the first occurrence of any character in a character array.  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.String.LastIndexOf%2A>, which returns the zero-based index of the last occurrence of a character or string in a string instance.  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.String.LastIndexOfAny%2A>, which returns a zero-based index in the current string instance of the last occurrence of any character in a character array.  \\n  \\n The following example uses the <xref:System.String.IndexOf%2A> method to find the periods in a string. It then uses the <xref:System.String.Substring%2A> method to return full sentences.  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[System.String.Split#11](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Split/cs/splitalt4.cs#11)]\\n [!code-vb[System.String.Split#11](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.Split/vb/splitalt4.vb#11)]  \\n  \\n## Performance Considerations  \\n The<xref:System.String.Split%2A> methods allocate memory for the returned array object and a <xref:System.String> object for each array element.
