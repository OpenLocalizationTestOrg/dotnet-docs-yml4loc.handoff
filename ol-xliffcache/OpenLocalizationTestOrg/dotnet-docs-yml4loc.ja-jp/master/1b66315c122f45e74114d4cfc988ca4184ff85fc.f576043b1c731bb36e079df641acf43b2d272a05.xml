However, we recommend that you use a specific culture name instead of a two-letter region name, because a <xref:System.Globalization.RegionInfo> object is not completely language-independent. Several <xref:System.Globalization.RegionInfo> properties, including <xref:System.Globalization.RegionInfo.DisplayName%2A>, <xref:System.Globalization.RegionInfo.NativeName%2A>, and <xref:System.Globalization.RegionInfo.CurrencyNativeName%2A>, depend on culture names.  \n  \n The following example illustrates the difference in <xref:System.Globalization.RegionInfo> property values for three objects that represent Belgium. The first is instantiated from a region name (BE) only, while the second and third are instantiated from culture names (fr-BE for French (Belgium) and and nl-BE for Dutch (Belgium), respectively). The example uses reflection to retrieve the property values of each <xref:System.Globalization.RegionInfo> object.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Globalization.RegionInfo#2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.Globalization.RegionInfo/CS/propertyvalues1.cs#2)]\n [!code-vb[System.Globalization.RegionInfo#2](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.Globalization.RegionInfo/VB/propertyvalues1.vb#2)]  \n  \n In scenarios such as the following, use culture names instead of country/region names when you instantiate a <xref:System.Globalization.RegionInfo> object:  \n  \n-   When the language name is of primary importance. For example, for the es-US culture name, you'll probably want your application to display \"Estados Unidos\" instead of \"United States\". Using the country/region name (US) alone yields \"United States\" regardless of the language, so you should work with the culture name instead.  \n  \n-   When script differences must be considered. For example, the country/region AZ deals with Azerbaijani cultures that have the names az-Latn-AZ and az-Cyrl-AZ, and the Latin and Cyrillic scripts can be very different for this country/region.  \n  \n-   When maintenance of detail is important. The values returned by <xref:System.Globalization.RegionInfo> members can differ depending on whether the <xref:System.Globalization.RegionInfo> object was instantiated by using a culture name or a region name.

Case is not significant. The <xref:System.Globalization.RegionInfo.Name%2A>, <xref:System.Globalization.RegionInfo.TwoLetterISORegionName%2A>, and <xref:System.Globalization.RegionInfo.ThreeLetterISORegionName%2A> properties return the appropriate codes in uppercase. For the current list of <xref:System.Globalization.RegionInfo> names, see [English country names and code elements](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=190591) on the ISO website.  \\n  \\n## Instantiating a RegionInfo Object  \\n To instantiate a <xref:System.Globalization.RegionInfo> object, you pass the <xref:System.Globalization.RegionInfo.%23ctor%28System.String%29> constructor either a two-letter region name, such as \\\"US\\\" for the United States, or the name of a specific culture, such as \\\"en-US\\\" for English (United States). However, we recommend that you use a specific culture name instead of a two-letter region name, because a <xref:System.Globalization.RegionInfo> object is not completely language-independent. Several <xref:System.Globalization.RegionInfo> properties, including <xref:System.Globalization.RegionInfo.DisplayName%2A>, <xref:System.Globalization.RegionInfo.NativeName%2A>, and <xref:System.Globalization.RegionInfo.CurrencyNativeName%2A>, depend on culture names.  \\n  \\n The following example illustrates the difference in <xref:System.Globalization.RegionInfo> property values for three objects that represent Belgium. The first is instantiated from a region name (BE) only, while the second and third are instantiated from culture names (fr-BE for French (Belgium) and and nl-BE for Dutch (Belgium), respectively). The example uses reflection to retrieve the property values of each <xref:System.Globalization.RegionInfo> object.  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[System.Globalization.RegionInfo#2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.Globalization.RegionInfo/CS/propertyvalues1.cs#2)]\\n [!code-vb[System.Globalization.RegionInfo#2](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.Globalization.RegionInfo/VB/propertyvalues1.vb#2)]  \\n  \\n In scenarios such as the following, use culture names instead of country/region names when you instantiate a <xref:System.Globalization.RegionInfo> object:  \\n  \\n-   When the language name is of primary importance. For example, for the es-US culture name, you'll probably want your application to display \\\"Estados Unidos\\\" instead of \\\"United States\\\". Using the country/region name (US) alone yields \\\"United States\\\" regardless of the language, so you should work with the culture name instead.  \\n  \\n-   When script differences must be considered. For example, the country/region AZ deals with Azerbaijani cultures that have the names az-Latn-AZ and az-Cyrl-AZ, and the Latin and Cyrillic scripts can be very different for this country/region.  \\n  \\n-   When maintenance of detail is important. The values returned by <xref:System.Globalization.RegionInfo> members can differ depending on whether the <xref:System.Globalization.RegionInfo> object was instantiated by using a culture name or a region name. For example, the following table lists the differences in return values when a <xref:System.Globalization.RegionInfo> object is instantiated by using the \\\"US\\\" region, the \\\"en-US\\\" culture, and the \\\"es-US\\\" culture.  \\n  \\n    |Member|\\\"US\\\"|\\\"en-US\\\"|\\\"es-US\\\"|  \\n    |------------|----------|--------------|--------------|  \\n    |<xref:System.Globalization.RegionInfo.CurrencyNativeName%2A>|US Dollar|US Dollar|Dólar de EE.UU.|  \\n    |<xref:System.Globalization.RegionInfo.Name%2A>|US|en-US|es-US|  \\n    |<xref:System.Globalization.RegionInfo.NativeName%2A>|United States|United States|Estados Unidos|  \\n    |<xref:System.Globalization.RegionInfo.ToString%2A>|US|en-US|es-US|\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following example demonstrates several members of the <xref:System.Globalization.RegionInfo> class.  \\n  \\n [!code-cpp[System.Globalization.RegionInfo#1](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.Globalization.RegionInfo/CPP/regioninfo.cpp#1)]\\n [!code-csharp[System.Globalization.RegionInfo#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.Globalization.RegionInfo/CS/regioninfo.cs#1)]\\n [!code-vb[System.Globalization.RegionInfo#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.Globalization.RegionInfo/VB/regioninfo.vb#1)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: >-\n      [System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComVisible(true)]\n\n      public class RegionInfo\n  inheritance:\n  - System.Object\n  implements: []\n  inheritedMembers:\n  - System.Object.Equals(System.Object,System.Object)\n  - System.Object.GetType\n  - System.Object.MemberwiseClone\n  - System.Object.ReferenceEquals(System.Object,System.Object)\n  attributes:\n  - type: System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComVisibleAttribute\n  version:\n  - netcore-1.0\n  - netcore-1.1\n  - netcore-2.0\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  - netstandard-1.0\n  - netstandard-1.1\n  - netstandard-1.2\n  - netstandard-1.3\n  - netstandard-1.4\n  - netstandard-1.6\n  - netstandard-2.0\n  - xamarinandroid-7.1\n  - xamarinios-10.8\n  - xamarinmac-3.0\n  monikers:\n  - netcore-1.0\n  - netcore-1.1\n  - netcore-2.0\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  - netstandard-1.0\n  - netstandard-1.1\n  - netstandard-1.2\n  - netstandard-1.3\n  - netstandard-1.4\n  - netstandard-1.6\n  - netstandard-2.0\n  - xamarinandroid-7.1\n  - xamarinios-10.8\n  - xamarinmac-3.0\n  content_git_url: https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/xml/System.Globalization/RegionInfo.xml\n  ms.technology:\n  - dotnet-standard\n  author: rpetrusha\n  ms.author: ronpet\n  manager: wpickett\n- uid: System.Globalization.RegionInfo.#ctor(System.Int32)\n  commentId: M:System.Globalization.RegionInfo.#ctor(System.Int32)\n  id: '#ctor(System.Int32)'\n  parent: System.Globalization.RegionInfo\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: RegionInfo(Int32)\n  nameWithType: RegionInfo.RegionInfo(Int32)\n  fullName: RegionInfo.RegionInfo(Int32)\n  type: Constructor\n  assemblies:\n  - mscorlib\n  - netstandard\n  - System.Runtime\n  namespace: System.Globalization\n  summary: Initializes a new instance of the <xref href=\"System.Globalization.RegionInfo\"></xref> class based on the country/region associated with the specified culture identifier.\n  remarks: \"<xref:System.Globalization.RegionInfo.%23ctor%28System.String%29> is the recommended constructor for instantiating a <xref:System.Globalization.RegionInfo> object.
