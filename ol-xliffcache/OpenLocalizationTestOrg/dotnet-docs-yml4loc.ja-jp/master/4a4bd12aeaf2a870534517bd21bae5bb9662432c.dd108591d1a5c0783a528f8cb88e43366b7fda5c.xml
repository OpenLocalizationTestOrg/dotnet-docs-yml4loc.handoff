When the user moves the pointing device, the operating system moves the cursor accordingly.  \\n  \\n Different cursor shapes are used to inform the user what operation the mouse will have. For example, when editing or selecting text, a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Cursors.IBeam%2A?displayProperty=fullName> cursor is typically displayed. A wait cursor is commonly used to inform the user that a process is currently running. Examples of processes you might have the user wait for are opening a file, saving a file, or filling a control such as a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListBox> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> with a large amount of data.  \\n  \\n All controls that derive from the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control> class have a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Cursor%2A> property. To change the cursor displayed by the mouse pointer when it is within the bounds of the control, assign a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Cursor> to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Cursor%2A> property of the control. Alternatively, you can display cursors at the application level by assigning a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Cursor> to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Cursor.Current%2A> property. For example, if the purpose of your application is to edit a text file, you might set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Cursor.Current%2A> property to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Cursors.WaitCursor%2A?displayProperty=fullName> to display a wait cursor over the application while the file loads or saves to prevent any mouse events from being processed. When the process is complete, set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Cursor.Current%2A> property to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Cursors.Default%2A?displayProperty=fullName> for the application to display the appropriate cursor over each control type.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  If you call <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Application.DoEvents%2A?displayProperty=fullName> before resetting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Cursor.Current%2A> property back to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Cursors.Default%2A?displayProperty=fullName> cursor, the application will resume listening for mouse events and will resume displaying the appropriate <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Cursor> for each control in the application.  \\n  \\n Cursor objects can be created from several sources, such as the handle of an existing <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Cursor>, a standard <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Cursor> file, a resource, or a data stream.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Cursor> class does not support animated cursors (.ani files) or cursors with colors other than black and white.  \\n  \\n If the image you are using as a cursor is too small, you can use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Cursor.DrawStretched%2A> method to force the image to fill the bounds of the cursor. You can temporarily hide the cursor by calling the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Cursor.Hide%2A> method, and restore it by calling the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Cursor.Show%2A> method.  \\n  \\n Starting with the .NET Framework 4.5.2, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Cursor> will be resized based on the system DPI setting when the app.config file contains the following entry:  \\n  \\n```  \\n<appSettings>  \\n  <add key=\\\"EnableWindowsFormsHighDpiAutoResizing\\\" value=\\\"true\\\" />  \\n</appSettings>  \\n```\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example displays a form that demonstrates using a custom cursor.
