For more information about these concepts, see [WPF Architecture](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/wpf-architecture.md).  \n  \n <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> extends <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> and adds the following capabilities:  \n  \n-   **Layout system definition**: <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> provides specific WPF framework-level implementations for certain methods that were defined as virtual members in  <xref:System.Windows.UIElement>. Most notably, <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> seals certain WPF core-level layout overrides, and instead provides a WPF framework-level equivalent that derived classes should override instead. For example, <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> seals <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.ArrangeCore%2A> but provides <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.ArrangeOverride%2A>. These changes reflect the fact that at the WPF framework-level there is a full layout system in place that can render any <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> derived class. At the WPF core level, certain members that will structure a general [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] based layout solution are in place, but the actual engine of the layout system is not defined. For more information, see [Layout](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/layout.md).  \n  \n-   **The logical tree:** The general [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] programming model is often expressed in terms of being a tree of elements. Support for expressing the tree of elements as a logical tree, and accompanying support for defining that tree in markup is implemented at the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> level. Note however that <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> deliberately does not define a content model, and leaves that responsibility to derived classes. For more information, see [Trees in WPF](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/trees-in-wpf.md).  \n  \n-   **Object lifetime events:** It is often useful to know when an element is initialized (the constructor is called) or when the element is first loaded into a logical tree. <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> defines several events related to object lifetime that provide useful hooks for code-behind operations that involve elements, such as adding more child elements. For more information, see [Object Lifetime Events](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/object-lifetime-events.md).  \n  \n-   **Support for data binding and dynamic resource references:** The property-level support for data binding and resources is implemented by the <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty> class and embodied in the property system, but the ability to resolve a member value that is stored as an <xref:System.Windows.Expression> (the programming construct that underlies both data binding and dynamic resources) is implemented by <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement>. For more information, see [Data Binding Overview](~/docs/framework/wpf/data/data-binding-overview.md) and [XAML Resources](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/xaml-resources.md).  \n  \n-   **Styles:** <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> defines the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Style%2A> property. However, <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> does not yet define support for templates, or support decorators. These features are introduced by control classes such as <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ContentControl>.  \n  \n-   **More animation support:** Some animation support was already defined at the WPF core level, but <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> extends this by implementing <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.BeginStoryboard%2A> and related members.  \n  \n As can be seen from the class hierarchy, many [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] classes derive from <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement>, either directly or through intermediate base classes such as <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel> or <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control>.  \n  \n If you intend to use <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> as a base class, you might want to first examine the existing derived classes. <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> provides support for a number of basic scenarios, but also lacks a number of features that are desirable for an \"element\" in the sense of a building block that you use to create [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_ui](~/includes/tlasharptla-ui-md.md)] in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](~/includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)].

There are several ways to remove a clock:  \n  \n-   To remove all clocks from a property, use the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Animatable.ApplyAnimationClock%28System.Windows.DependencyProperty%2CSystem.Windows.Media.Animation.AnimationClock%29> or <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Animatable.BeginAnimation%28System.Windows.DependencyProperty%2CSystem.Windows.Media.Animation.AnimationTimeline%29> method of the animated object. Specify the property being animated as the first parameter, and `null` as the second. This removes all animation clocks from the property.  \n  \n-   To remove a specific <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.AnimationClock> from a list of clocks, use the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Clock.Controller%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.AnimationClock> to retrieve a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.ClockController>, then call the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.ClockController.Remove%2A> method of the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.ClockController>. This is typically done in the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Clock.Completed> event handler for a clock. Note that only root clocks can be controlled by a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.ClockController>; the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Clock.Controller%2A> property of a child clock returns `null`. Note also that the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Clock.Completed> event is not raised if the effective duration of the clock is forever.  In that case, the user must determine when to call <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.ClockController.Remove%2A>.  \n  \n This is primarily an issue for animations on objects that have a long lifetime.  When an object is garbage collected, its clocks are also disconnected and garbage collected.  \n  \n For more information about clock objects, see [Animation and Timing System Overview](~/docs/framework/wpf/graphics-multimedia/animation-and-timing-system-overview.md).","nodes":[{"pos":[0,492],"content":"Most typical animation scenarios do not use this method.

You must specifically call <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.RegisterName%2A> to make an effective change to the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Name%2A> property of an already loaded element.  \n  \n One notable case where setting <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Name%2A> from code is important is when registering names for elements that storyboards will run against, so that they can be referenced at run time. Before you can register a name, might also need to instantiate and assign a <xref:System.Windows.NameScope> instance. See the Example section, or [Storyboards Overview](~/docs/framework/wpf/graphics-multimedia/storyboards-overview.md).  \n  \n Setting <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Name%2A> from code has limited applications, but getting an element by <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Name%2A> is more common. One particular scenario is if your application supports a navigation model where pages reload into the application, and the run time code is not necessarily code-behind defined for that page. The utility method <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.FindName%2A>, which is available from any <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement>, can find any element by <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Name%2A> in the logical tree for that element, searching the tree recursively as necessary. Or you can use the <xref:System.Windows.LogicalTreeHelper.FindLogicalNode%2A> static method of <xref:System.Windows.LogicalTreeHelper>, which also takes a <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Name%2A> string as an argument.  \n  \n Typically used root elements (<xref:System.Windows.Window>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> for example) implement the interface <xref:System.Windows.Markup.INameScope>. Implementations of this interface are expected to enforce that names be unambiguous within their scope. The root elements that define this interface also define the namescope behavior boundaries for all the related [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_api#plural](~/includes/tla2sharptla-apisharpplural-md.md)].  \n  \n The <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Name%2A> property also serves as an identifier for other processes. For instance, the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] automation model will use <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Name%2A> as the AutomationId for clients and providers.  \n  \n The string values used for <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Name%2A> have some restrictions, as imposed by the underlying [x:Name Directive](~/docs/framework/xaml-services/x-name-directive.md) defined by the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] specification. Most notably, a <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Name%2A> must start with a letter or the underscore character (_), and must contain only letters, digits, or underscores. For more information, see [WPF XAML Namescopes](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/wpf-xaml-namescopes.md).  \n  \n <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Name%2A> is one of the very few dependency properties that cannot be animated (<xref:System.Windows.UIPropertyMetadata.IsAnimationProhibited%2A> is `true` in metadata), because the name itself is vital for targeting an animation. Data binding a <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Name%2A> is technically possible, but is an extremely uncommon scenario because a data-bound <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Name%2A> cannot serve the main intended purpose of the property: to provide an identifier connection point for code-behind.  \n  \n<a name=\"dependencyPropertyInfo_Name\"></a>   \n## Dependency Property Information  \n  \n|||  \n|-|-|  \n|Identifier field|<xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.NameProperty>|  \n|Metadata properties set to `true`|<xref:System.Windows.UIPropertyMetadata.IsAnimationProhibited%2A>|","nodes":[{"pos":[0,156],"content":"The most common usage of this property is to specify a <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)]</ph> element name as an attribute in markup.","source":"The most common usage of this property is to specify a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] element name as an attribute in markup."},{"pos":[163,385],"content":"This property essentially provides a WPF framework-level convenience property to set the <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)]</ph> <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>x:Name Directive<ept id=\"p1\">](~/docs/framework/xaml-services/x-name-directive.md)</ept>.","source":"This property essentially provides a WPF framework-level convenience property to set the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] [x:Name Directive](~/docs/framework/xaml-services/x-name-directive.md)."},{"pos":[392,535],"content":"Names must be unique within a namescope.

PresentationFramework\n  namespace: System.Windows\n  summary: Provides a WPF framework-level set of properties, events, and methods for Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) elements. This class represents the provided WPF framework-level implementation that is built on the WPF core-level APIs that are defined by <xref href=\"System.Windows.UIElement\"></xref>.\n  remarks: \"<xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> is the connecting point between WPF framework-level element classes and the WPF core-level set of <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> presentation services. For more information about these concepts, see [WPF Architecture](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/wpf-architecture.md).  \\n  \\n <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> extends <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> and adds the following capabilities:  \\n  \\n-   **Layout system definition**: <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> provides specific WPF framework-level implementations for certain methods that were defined as virtual members in  <xref:System.Windows.UIElement>. Most notably, <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> seals certain WPF core-level layout overrides, and instead provides a WPF framework-level equivalent that derived classes should override instead. For example, <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> seals <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.ArrangeCore%2A> but provides <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.ArrangeOverride%2A>. These changes reflect the fact that at the WPF framework-level there is a full layout system in place that can render any <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> derived class. At the WPF core level, certain members that will structure a general [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] based layout solution are in place, but the actual engine of the layout system is not defined. For more information, see [Layout](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/layout.md).  \\n  \\n-   **The logical tree:** The general [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] programming model is often expressed in terms of being a tree of elements. Support for expressing the tree of elements as a logical tree, and accompanying support for defining that tree in markup is implemented at the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> level. Note however that <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> deliberately does not define a content model, and leaves that responsibility to derived classes. For more information, see [Trees in WPF](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/trees-in-wpf.md).  \\n  \\n-   **Object lifetime events:** It is often useful to know when an element is initialized (the constructor is called) or when the element is first loaded into a logical tree. <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> defines several events related to object lifetime that provide useful hooks for code-behind operations that involve elements, such as adding more child elements. For more information, see [Object Lifetime Events](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/object-lifetime-events.md).  \\n  \\n-   **Support for data binding and dynamic resource references:** The property-level support for data binding and resources is implemented by the <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty> class and embodied in the property system, but the ability to resolve a member value that is stored as an <xref:System.Windows.Expression> (the programming construct that underlies both data binding and dynamic resources) is implemented by <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement>. For more information, see [Data Binding Overview](~/docs/framework/wpf/data/data-binding-overview.md) and [XAML Resources](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/xaml-resources.md).  \\n  \\n-   **Styles:** <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> defines the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Style%2A> property. However, <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> does not yet define support for templates, or support decorators. These features are introduced by control classes such as <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ContentControl>.  \\n  \\n-   **More animation support:** Some animation support was already defined at the WPF core level, but <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> extends this by implementing <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.BeginStoryboard%2A> and related members.  \\n  \\n As can be seen from the class hierarchy, many [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] classes derive from <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement>, either directly or through intermediate base classes such as <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel> or <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control>.  \\n  \\n If you intend to use <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> as a base class, you might want to first examine the existing derived classes. <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> provides support for a number of basic scenarios, but also lacks a number of features that are desirable for an \\\"element\\\" in the sense of a building block that you use to create [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_ui](~/includes/tlasharptla-ui-md.md)] in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](~/includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)]. For instance, a <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> does not define any true content model; <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> as a base class does not define a property that can create [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] child elements. In particular, you might want to look at <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ContentControl>.\"\n  syntax:\n    content: >-\n      [System.Windows.Markup.RuntimeNameProperty(\"Name\")]\n\n      [System.Windows.Markup.UsableDuringInitialization(true)]\n\n      [System.Windows.Markup.XmlLangProperty(\"Language\")]\n\n      [System.Windows.StyleTypedProperty(Property=\"FocusVisualStyle\", StyleTargetType=typeof(System.Windows.Controls.Control))]\n\n      public class FrameworkElement : System.Windows.UIElement, System.ComponentModel.ISupportInitialize, System.Windows.IFrameworkInputElement, System.Windows.Markup.IQueryAmbient\n  inheritance:\n  -

Also, event-related considerations such as an active drag, mouse capture, text editing modes within controls, and so on, will also affect the cursor with higher priority than the value you specify in this property.  \\n  \\n To revert the behavior of setting this property to the eventual default, set it to `null` again.  \\n  \\n The `null` default really means that determination of the practical cursor value is deferred here and should be obtained from elsewhere. If presented without programmatic values from any source, the default cursor that is visually over a [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](~/includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] application will be an arrow. However, the transient cursor changes are not set to the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Cursor%2A> values of the elements when they are passed over. The <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Cursor%2A> property will only report non null values in cases where it was actually set, for instance through code or a style. Each movement of the mouse over a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] application raises a <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.QueryCursor> event. The event bubbles, and any element along the route has the opportunity to handle the event and to set the value of the cursor through the arguments of this event. This is the mechanism that produces the visually apparent cursor in most cases. If a <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.QueryCursor> handler returns a cursor result, then the fact that the event is handled and has a changed value in the arguments takes precedence over the value of the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Cursor%2A> property at any level, unless <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.ForceCursor%2A> is set.  \\n  \\n If not are not creating a custom cursor, you typically set this property to a static property value of the <xref:System.Windows.Input.Cursors> class. Setting <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Cursor%2A> in code requires one of the following:  \\n  \\n-   Call the <xref:System.Windows.Input.Cursor> constructor to get a <xref:System.Windows.Input.Cursor> instance. Both signatures of the <xref:System.Windows.Input.Cursor> constructor use streams or files, in anticipation that you are creating the <xref:System.Windows.Input.Cursor> object for a custom cursor.  \\n  \\n-   Use the <xref:System.Windows.Input.CursorConverter> class and its <xref:System.Windows.Input.CursorConverter.ConvertFrom%2A> method to specify a cursor by <xref:System.Windows.Input.CursorType>, or a string that can evaluate to a <xref:System.Windows.Input.CursorType>, and cast the return to <xref:System.Windows.Input.Cursor>.  \\n  \\n Setting the <xref:System.Windows.Input.Cursor> to a custom value is not enabled in partial trust.

The other two are <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.MinHeight%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.MaxHeight%2A>. If there is a conflict between these values, the order of application for actual height determination is that first <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.MinHeight%2A> must be honored, then <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.MaxHeight%2A>, and finally, if it is within bounds, <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Height%2A>.  \\n  \\n If this element is a child element within some other element, then setting this property to a value is really only a suggested value. The layout system as well as the particular layout logic of the parent element will use the value as a nonbinding input during the layout process. In practical terms, a <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> is almost always the child element of something else; even when you set the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Height%2A> on <xref:System.Windows.Window>. (For <xref:System.Windows.Window>, that value is used when the underlying application model establishes the basic rendering assumptions that create the Hwnd that hosts the application.)  \\n  \\n In addition to acceptable <xref:System.Double> values, this property can also be <xref:System.Double.NaN?displayProperty=fullName>. This is how you specify auto sizing behavior in code. In [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] you set the value to the string \\\"Auto\\\" (case insensitive) to enable the auto sizing behavior. Auto sizing behavior implies that the element will fill the height available to it. Note however that specific controls frequently supply default values through their default theme styles that will disable the auto sizing behavior unless it is specifically re-enabled.  \\n  \\n The return value of this property is always the same as any value that was set to it. In contrast, the value of the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.ActualHeight%2A> may vary. This can happen either statically because the layout rejected the suggested size for some reason, or momentarily. The layout system itself works asynchronously relative to the property system's set of <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Height%2A> and may not have processed that particular sizing property change yet.  \\n  \\n The value restrictions on the <xref:System.Double> value are enforced by a <xref:System.Windows.ValidateValueCallback> mechanism. If you attempt to set an invalid value, a run-time exception is thrown.  \\n  \\n In addition to the validation check, there is a nondeterministic upper value bound for <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Height%2A> that is enforced by the layout system (this is a very large number, larger than <xref:System.Single.MaxValue?displayProperty=fullName> but smaller than <xref:System.Double.MaxValue?displayProperty=fullName>). If you exceed this bound, the element will not render, and no exception is thrown.

For more information, see [WPF XAML Namescopes](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/wpf-xaml-namescopes.md).  \\n  \\n Getting a <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Name%2A> if you are creating elements in code is not common. If you have the appropriate reference in code already, you can just call methods and properties on the element reference and will not generally need the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Name%2A>. An exception to this is if the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Name%2A> string has some overloaded meaning, for instance if it is useful to display that name in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](~/includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)]. Setting a <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Name%2A> from code-behind if the original <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Name%2A> was set from markup is also not recommended, and changing the property after loading the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] will not change the original object reference. The object references are created only when the underlying namescopes are explicitly created during parsing. You must specifically call <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.RegisterName%2A> to make an effective change to the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Name%2A> property of an already loaded element.  \\n  \\n One notable case where setting <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Name%2A> from code is important is when registering names for elements that storyboards will run against, so that they can be referenced at run time. Before you can register a name, might also need to instantiate and assign a <xref:System.Windows.NameScope> instance. See the Example section, or [Storyboards Overview](~/docs/framework/wpf/graphics-multimedia/storyboards-overview.md).  \\n  \\n Setting <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Name%2A> from code has limited applications, but getting an element by <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Name%2A> is more common. One particular scenario is if your application supports a navigation model where pages reload into the application, and the run time code is not necessarily code-behind defined for that page. The utility method <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.FindName%2A>, which is available from any <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement>, can find any element by <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Name%2A> in the logical tree for that element, searching the tree recursively as necessary. Or you can use the <xref:System.Windows.LogicalTreeHelper.FindLogicalNode%2A> static method of <xref:System.Windows.LogicalTreeHelper>, which also takes a <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Name%2A> string as an argument.  \\n  \\n Typically used root elements (<xref:System.Windows.Window>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> for example) implement the interface <xref:System.Windows.Markup.INameScope>. Implementations of this interface are expected to enforce that names be unambiguous within their scope. The root elements that define this interface also define the namescope behavior boundaries for all the related [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_api#plural](~/includes/tla2sharptla-apisharpplural-md.md)].  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Name%2A> property also serves as an identifier for other processes. For instance, the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] automation model will use <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Name%2A> as the AutomationId for clients and providers.  \\n  \\n The string values used for <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Name%2A> have some restrictions, as imposed by the underlying [x:Name Directive](~/docs/framework/xaml-services/x-name-directive.md) defined by the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] specification. Most notably, a <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Name%2A> must start with a letter or the underscore character (_), and must contain only letters, digits, or underscores. For more information, see [WPF XAML Namescopes](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/wpf-xaml-namescopes.md).  \\n  \\n <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Name%2A> is one of the very few dependency properties that cannot be animated (<xref:System.Windows.UIPropertyMetadata.IsAnimationProhibited%2A> is `true` in metadata), because the name itself is vital for targeting an animation. Data binding a <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Name%2A> is technically possible, but is an extremely uncommon scenario because a data-bound <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Name%2A> cannot serve the main intended purpose of the property: to provide an identifier connection point for code-behind.  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"dependencyPropertyInfo_Name\\\"></a>   \\n## Dependency Property Information  \\n  \\n|||  \\n|-|-|  \\n|Identifier field|<xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.NameProperty>|  \\n|Metadata properties set to `true`|<xref:System.Windows.UIPropertyMetadata.IsAnimationProhibited%2A>|\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following example sets the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Name%2A> property in code, and then registers the name into the newly created <xref:System.Windows.NameScope> by calling <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.RegisterName%2A>.

One potential scenario is to take the arguments of the event and deliberately mark the event as handled to shorten the route.\"\n  syntax:\n    content: protected virtual void OnToolTipOpening (System.Windows.Controls.ToolTipEventArgs e);\n    parameters:\n    - id: e\n      type: System.Windows.Controls.ToolTipEventArgs\n      description: Provides data about the event.\n  overload: System.Windows.FrameworkElement.OnToolTipOpening*\n  exceptions: []\n  version:\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  monikers:\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  content_git_url: https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/xml/System.Windows/FrameworkElement.xml\n  ms.technology:\n  - dotnet-wpf\n  author: stevehoag\n  ms.author: shoag\n  manager: wpickett\n- uid: System.Windows.FrameworkElement.OnVisualParentChanged(System.Windows.DependencyObject)\n  commentId: M:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.OnVisualParentChanged(System.Windows.DependencyObject)\n  id: OnVisualParentChanged(System.Windows.DependencyObject)\n  parent: System.Windows.FrameworkElement\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: OnVisualParentChanged(DependencyObject)\n  nameWithType: FrameworkElement.OnVisualParentChanged(DependencyObject)\n  fullName: FrameworkElement.OnVisualParentChanged(DependencyObject)\n  type: Method\n  assemblies:\n  - PresentationFramework\n  namespace: System.Windows\n  summary: Invoked when the parent of this element in the visual tree is changed.

Placing the resource dictionary at this level makes it easier to find from individual child elements in the page (or from any page, in the application case). In most application scenarios, we recommend that styles be defined as object elements within a resource dictionary, or be defined as external resources so that the entire style resource can be self-contained (this approach helps separate designer responsibilities from developer responsibilities by separating the physical files that need to be edited).  \\n  \\n Note that this property returns only the resource dictionary declared directly within that element. This is different than the actual resource lookup process, where a child element can access any of the resources defined in each parent element, searching recursively upwards.  \\n  \\n Resources can also be referenced by code from within the collection, but be aware that resources created in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] will definitely not be accessible until after <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Loaded> is raised by the element that declares the dictionary. In fact, resources are parsed asynchronously and not even the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Loaded> event is an assurance that you can reference a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] defined resource. For this reason you should generally only access [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] defined resources as part of run-time code, or through other [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] techniques such as styles or resource extension references for attribute values. When you access resources through code, it is essentially equivalent to a  reference made from [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)].  \\n  \\n The underlying <xref:System.Windows.ResourceDictionary> supports the methods required to add, remove or query resources from within the collection by using code. The <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Resources%2A> property is settable to support the scenario of completely replacing the resources collection of an element to be a new or different <xref:System.Windows.ResourceDictionary>.  \\n  \\n Notice that the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] syntax shown does not include an element for the <xref:System.Windows.ResourceDictionary>. This is an example of implicit collection syntax; a tag representing the collection element can be omitted. The elements that are added as items to the collection are specified instead. For more information about implicit collections and [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)], see [XAML Syntax In Detail](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/xaml-syntax-in-detail.md). One case where a <xref:System.Windows.ResourceDictionary> is still specified explicitly as an element is if you are introducing a merged dictionary, in which case there are typically no child elements for that <xref:System.Windows.ResourceDictionary>.

This property does not set or return default (theme) styles, but it does return either an implicit style or an explicit style that is acting on the element.

You can reset the entire <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Style%2A> property to a new <xref:System.Windows.Style> at any time, which will force a layout recomposition. However, as soon as that style is placed in use by a loaded element, the <xref:System.Windows.Style> should be considered sealed.

If the style is still null after this step, then the acting style for presentation purposes generally comes from the default (theme) style, but the default style is not returned in the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Style%2A> property value.

The layout system adds child coordinates to the parent coordinates; therefore, if the parent coordinates are not on a pixel boundary, the child coordinates are also not on a pixel boundary. If <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.UseLayoutRounding%2A> cannot be set at the root, set <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.SnapsToDevicePixels%2A> on the child to obtain the effect that you want.  \\n  \\n Drawing objects on pixel boundaries eliminates the semi-transparent edges that are produced by anti-aliasing, when an edge falls in the middle of a device pixel. The following illustration shows the output of a single pixel-width line that falls in the middle of a device pixel. The line on the left does not use layout rounding and is anti-aliased.

For example, if a grid has a total width of 100 with 3 columns each of size <xref:System.Windows.GridUnitType.Star>, instead of creating three columns that have an equal width of 33.3, the layout system creates 2 columns that have a width of 33 and one that has a width of 34.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  In .NET 4.6 changes were made to layout rounding to reduce instances of clipping in controls with borders. By default, this feature is enabled if your Target Framework is .NET Framework 4.6 or higher. Applications that target earlier versions of the framework can opt in into the new behavior by adding the following setting to an app.config file: `<runtime><AppContextSwitchOverrides value=\\\"Switch.MS.Internal.DoNotApplyLayoutRoundingToMarginsAndBorderThickness=false\\\"/></runtime>` The setting only takes effect when the application is running on the .NET Framework 4.6.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following example demonstrates the effect that the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.UseLayoutRounding%2A> property has on a single pixel-width line.
