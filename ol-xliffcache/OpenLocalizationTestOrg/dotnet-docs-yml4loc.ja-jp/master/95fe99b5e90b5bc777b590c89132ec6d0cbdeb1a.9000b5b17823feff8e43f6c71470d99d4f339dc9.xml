However, the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Compatibility.VB6.TreeViewArray.MouseClick> event will not be raised if the click is caused by action other than that of the mouse, such as pressing the ENTER key.  \\n  \\n A double-click is determined by the mouse settings of the user's operating system. The user can set the time between clicks of a mouse button that should be considered a double-click instead of two clicks. The `Click` event is raised every time that a control is double-clicked. For example, if you have event handlers for the `Click` and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DoubleClick> events of a control, the `Click` and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DoubleClick> events are raised when the control is double-clicked and both methods are called.
