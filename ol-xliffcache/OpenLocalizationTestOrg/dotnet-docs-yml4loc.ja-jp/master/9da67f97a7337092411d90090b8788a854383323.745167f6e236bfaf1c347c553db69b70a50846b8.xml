Although the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> class manages the high-level life cycle of personalization, it is the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartPersonalization> class that is responsible for actually implementing the physical steps necessary to carry out specific personalization actions. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartPersonalization> class in turn relies on an implementation of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PersonalizationProvider> to communicate with the underlying data store for personalization information.  \\n  \\n If you use the default implementation of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager>, it creates an instance of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartPersonalization> class that you can use by referencing the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.Personalization%2A> property. For example, to access the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartPersonalization.InitialScope%2A> property, you would specify `WebPartManager.Personalization.InitialScope`.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example shows how the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartPersonalization> class is used, as well as providing an example of how personalization scope affects the results of personalized properties. This example has five files:  \\n  \\n-   An .aspx page that declaratively creates two Web Part zones, each with a control.  \\n  \\n-   A user control called `Color.ascx` that allows a user to change a personalized property that applies a text box background color based on the user's authorization rights to modify state information and to enter shared scope.  \\n  \\n-   A user control called `Persmode.ascx` that indicates what the current page scope is and what rights the current user has to enter shared scope or to modify data; it also provides two buttons; one to change scope and one to reset current user personalization information.  \\n  \\n-   A login control that is used to authorize users.  \\n  \\n-   A Web.config file with a section that provides an example of authorizing a user to modify personalization state and to enter shared scope.  \\n  \\n The following code creates an aspx page  with a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> and two Web Part zones and displays the `Color.ascx` and `Persmode.ascx` controls.

Use the ASP.NET Web Site Administration Tool in [!INCLUDE[vsprvsext](~/includes/vsprvsext-md.md)] to create users to access the page.
