The state of an object can be obtained using the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ICommunicationObject.State%2A> property.  \n  \n There are four main states and two transient states that a communication object can occupy. The main states are:  \n  \n-   Created  \n  \n-   Opened  \n  \n-   Closed  \n  \n-   Faulted  \n  \n The two transitory states that a communication object can occupy when transitioning between these main states are:  \n  \n-   Opening  \n  \n-   Closing  \n  \n The communication object can be configured in the Created state. For example, its properties can be changed, and its events can be registered. No input or output can occur in this state. So messages, for example, cannot be sent or received from a channel in this state.  \n  \n The Opening is a temporary state that the communication object enters when the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ICommunicationObject.Open%2A> method is invoked. Unless otherwise noted on derived classes, objects in the opening state cannot be configured. This transition state can only be entered from the Created state.  \n  \n Objects transition to the Opened state when the open process completes.
