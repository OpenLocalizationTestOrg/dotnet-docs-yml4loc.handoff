The counters that the provider provides is defined in an XML-based manifest. The counters are logically grouped into counter sets. The counters within a counter set are identified by a numeric identifier that is unique within the counter set. A provider can define one or more counter sets. A counter set is identified by a Guid that is unique to a provider. Note that if you use these classes to write your provider:  \n  \n    -   The callback attribute of the provider element is ignored.  \n  \n    -   The reference value for the name attribute of the counterAttribute element is ignored.  \n  \n     For details on writing the manifest, see [Performance Counters Schema](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa373092\\(v=vs.85\\).aspx).  \n  \n2.  After writing your manifest, use the [CTRPP](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa372128\\(v=vs.85\\).aspx) tool to compile the manifest (ctrpp provider.man). The tool generates four files: .h, .c, .rc, and *_r.h. You can ignore the .h and .c files. The .rc file contains the localized strings defined in your manifest. You use the .rc and *_r.h files to create the compiled resource file (.res) that you include in your project. The following call shows how to compile the resource file:  \n  \n    ```  \n    rc /r /i \"c:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SDKs\\Windows\\v6.0\\Include\" provider.rc  \n    ```  \n  \n     If you get an error that references sal.h, copy the sal.h file from your Microsoft Visual Studio, Visual C include directory to the directory you specify for the /i switch.  \n  \n     Add a path to the compiled resource file (.res) to your project's Application property page.  \n  \n3.  Write your provider. The following steps show the calls made by a provider:  \n  \n    1.  Call the <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceData.CounterSet.%23ctor%2A?displayProperty=fullName> constructor to define the counter set. Call this method for each counter set defined in the manifest.  \n  \n    2.  For each counter set, call one of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceData.CounterSet.AddCounter%2A?displayProperty=fullName> methods to add the counters to the set. Call this method for each counter defined in the counter set.  \n  \n    3.  Call the <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceData.CounterSet.CreateCounterSetInstance%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method to create an instance of the counter set (an instance contains the counter data). For single instance counter sets, call this method one time. For multiple instance counter sets, call this method for each instance for which you need to provide counter data (use a unique name for each instance).  \n  \n    4.  Use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceData.CounterSetInstance.Counters%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property to access and set the counter data for the counter.  \n  \n4.  After you finish your provider, use the LodCtr tool to register the counters on the computer. For example,  \n  \n    ```  \n    lodctr /m:provider.man  \n    ```  \n  \n     The example assumes the manifest and executable file are in the current directory.
