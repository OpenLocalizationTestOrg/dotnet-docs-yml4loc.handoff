It is similar to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.DetailsView> control, except it displays user-defined templates instead of row fields. Creating your own templates gives you greater flexibility in controlling how the data is displayed. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control supports the following features:  \n  \n-   Binding to data source controls, such as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SqlDataSource> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.ObjectDataSource>.  \n  \n-   Built-in inserting capabilities.  \n  \n-   Built-in updating and deleting capabilities.  \n  \n-   Built-in paging capabilities.  \n  \n-   Programmatic access to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> object model to dynamically set properties, handle events, and so on.  \n  \n-   Customizable appearance through user-defined templates, themes, and styles.  \n  \n<a name=\"templates\"></a>   \n## Templates  \n For the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control to display content, you need to create templates for the different parts of the control. Most templates are optional; however, you must create a template for the mode in which the control is configured. For example, a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control that supports inserting records must have an insert item template defined. The following table lists the different templates that you can create.  \n  \n|Template type|Description|  \n|-------------------|-----------------|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.EditItemTemplate%2A>|Defines the content for the data row when the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control is in edit mode. This template usually contains input controls and command buttons with which the user can edit an existing record.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.EmptyDataTemplate%2A>|Defines the content for the empty data row displayed when the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control is bound to a data source that does not contain any records. This template usually contains content to alert the user that the data source does not contain any records.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.FooterTemplate%2A>|Defines the content for the footer row. This template usually contains any additional content you would like to display in the footer row. **Note:**  As an alternative, you can simply specify text to display in the footer row by setting the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.FooterText%2A> property.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.HeaderTemplate%2A>|Defines the content for the header row. This template usually contains any additional content you would like to display in the header row. **Note:**  As an alternative, you can simply specify text to display in the header row by setting the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.HeaderText%2A> property.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.ItemTemplate%2A>|Defines the content for the data row when the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control is in read-only mode. This template usually contains content to display the values of an existing record.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.InsertItemTemplate%2A>|Defines the content for the data row when the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control is in insert mode. This template usually contains input controls and command buttons with which the user can add a new record.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.PagerTemplate%2A>|Defines the content for the pager row displayed when the paging feature is enabled (when the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.AllowPaging%2A> property is set to `true`). This template usually contains controls with which the user can navigate to another record. **Note:**  The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control has a built-in pager row user interface (UI). You need to create a pager template only if you want to create your own custom pager row.|  \n  \n To display the value of a field in an item template, use a data binding expression. For more information on data binding expressions, see [Data-Binding Expression Syntax](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/676beb1d-ddfa-4153-bba8-3c86dcb7ceca).  \n  \n Input controls in the edit item template and insert item template can be bound to the fields of a data source by using a two-way binding expression. This allows the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control to automatically extract the values of the input control for an update or insert operation. Two-way binding expressions also allow input controls in an edit item template to automatically display the original field values. For more information on two-way binding expressions, see [Binding to Databases](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/ab7b2846-975b-4057-a948-45527497c742).  \n  \n<a name=\"binding_to_data\"></a>   \n## Binding to Data  \n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control can be bound to a data source control (such as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SqlDataSource>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.ObjectDataSource>, or <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AccessDataSource>) or to any data source collection that implements the <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerable?displayProperty=fullName> interface, such as <xref:System.Data.DataView?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601?displayProperty=fullName>, or other collection types. Use one of the following methods to bind the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control to the appropriate data source type:  \n  \n-   To bind to a data source control, set the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.DataBoundControl.DataSourceID%2A> property of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control to the <xref:System.Web.UI.Control.ID%2A> value of the data source control. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control automatically binds to the specified data source control and can take advantage of the data source control's capabilities to perform inserting, updating, deleting, and paging functionality. This is the preferred method to bind to data.  \n  \n-   To bind to a data source that implements the <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerable?displayProperty=fullName> interface, programmatically set the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.BaseDataBoundControl.DataSource%2A> property of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control to the data source and then call the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.BaseDataBoundControl.DataBind%2A> method. When using this method, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control does not provide built-in inserting, updating, deleting, and paging functionality. You need to provide this functionality by using the appropriate event.  \n  \n For more information on data binding, see [ASP.NET Data Access Content Map](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/f9219396-a0fa-481f-894d-e3d9c67d64f2).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This control can be used to display user input, which might include malicious client script. Check any information that is sent from a client for executable script, SQL statements, or other code before displaying it in your application. Whenever possible, it is strongly recommended that values are HTML-encoded before they are displayed in this control. ASP.NET provides an input request validation feature to block script and HTML in user input. Validation server controls are also provided to assess user input. For more information, see [Introduction to the Validation Controls](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/3c0e7514-cff2-4bed-936d-ee3f7b740190).  \n  \n<a name=\"data_operations\"></a>   \n## Data Operations  \n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control provides many built-in capabilities that allow the user to update, delete, insert, and page through items in the control. When the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control is bound to a data source control, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control can take advantage of the data source control's capabilities and provide automatic updating, deleting, inserting, and paging functionality.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control can provide support for update, delete, insert, and paging operations with other types of data sources; however, you must provide an appropriate event handler with the implementation for these operations.  \n  \n Because the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control uses templates, it does not provide a way to automatically generate command buttons to perform updating, deleting, or inserting operations. You must manually include these command buttons in the appropriate template. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control recognizes certain buttons that have their `CommandName` properties set to specific values. The following table lists the command buttons that the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control recognizes.  \n  \n|Button|CommandName value|Description|  \n|------------|-----------------------|-----------------|  \n|Cancel|\"Cancel\"|Used in updating or inserting operations to cancel the operation and to discard the values entered by the user. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control then returns to the mode specified by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.DefaultMode%2A> property.|  \n|Delete|\"Delete\"|Used in deleting operations to delete the displayed record from the data source. Raises the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.ItemDeleting> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.ItemDeleted> events.|  \n|Edit|\"Edit\"|Used in updating operations to put the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control in edit mode. The content specified in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.EditItemTemplate%2A> property is displayed for the data row.|  \n|Insert|\"Insert\"|Used in inserting operations to attempt to insert a new record in the data source using the values provided by the user. Raises the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.ItemInserting> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.ItemInserted> events.|  \n|New|\"New\"|Used in inserting operations to put the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control in insert mode. The content specified in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.InsertItemTemplate%2A> property is displayed for the data row.|  \n|Page|\"Page\"|Used in paging operations to represent a button in the pager row that performs paging. To specify the paging operation, set the `CommandArgument` property of the button to \"Next\", \"Prev\", \"First\", \"Last\", or the index of the page to which to navigate. Raises the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.PageIndexChanging> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.PageIndexChanged> events. **Note:**  This type of button is typically used only in the pager template.|  \n|Update|\"Update\"|Used in updating operations to attempt to update the displayed record in the data source with the values provided by the user. Raises the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.ItemUpdating> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.ItemUpdated> events.|  \n  \n Unlike the Delete button (which deletes the displayed record immediately), when the Edit or New button is clicked, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control goes into edit or insert mode, respectively. In edit mode, the content contained in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.EditItemTemplate%2A> property is displayed for the current data item. Typically, the edit item template is defined such that the Edit button is replaced with an Update and a Cancel button. Input controls that are appropriate for the field's data type (such as a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.TextBox> or a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.CheckBox> control) are also usually displayed with a field's value for the user to modify. Clicking the Update button updates the record in the data source, while clicking the Cancel button abandons any changes.  \n  \n Likewise, the content contained in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.InsertItemTemplate%2A> property is displayed for the data item when the control is in insert mode. The insert item template is typically defined such that the New button is replaced with an Insert and a Cancel button, and empty input controls are displayed for the user to enter the values for the new record. Clicking the Insert button inserts the record in the data source, while clicking the Cancel button abandons any changes.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control provides a paging feature, which allows the user to navigate to other records in the data source. When enabled, a pager row is displayed in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control that contains the page navigation controls. To enable paging, set the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.AllowPaging%2A> property to `true`. You can customize the pager row by setting the properties of objects contained in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.PagerStyle%2A> and the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.PagerSettings%2A> property. Instead of using the built-in pager row UI, you can create your own UI by using the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.PagerTemplate%2A> property.  \n  \n<a name=\"customizing_the_user_interface\"></a>   \n## Customizing the User Interface  \n You can customize the appearance of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control by setting the style properties for the different parts of the control. The following table lists the different style properties.  \n  \n|Style property|Description|  \n|--------------------|-----------------|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.EditRowStyle%2A>|The style settings for the data row when the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control is in edit mode.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.EmptyDataRowStyle%2A>|The style settings for the empty data row displayed in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control when the data source does not contain any records.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.FooterStyle%2A>|The style settings for the footer row of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.HeaderStyle%2A>|The style settings for the header row of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.InsertRowStyle%2A>|The style settings for the data row when the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control is in insert mode.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.PagerStyle%2A>|The style settings for the pager row displayed in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control when the paging feature is enabled.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.RowStyle%2A>|The style settings for the data row when the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control is in read-only mode.|  \n  \n<a name=\"events\"></a>   \n## Events  \n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control provides several events that you can program against. This allows you to run a custom routine whenever an event occurs. The following table lists the events supported by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control.  \n  \n|Event|Description|  \n|-----------|-----------------|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.ItemCommand>|Occurs when a button within a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control is clicked. This event is often used to perform a task when a button is clicked in the control.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.ItemCreated>|Occurs after all <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormViewRow> objects are created in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control. This event is often used to modify the values of a record before it is displayed.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.ItemDeleted>|Occurs when a Delete button (a button with its `CommandName` property set to \"Delete\") is clicked, but after the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control deletes the record from the data source. This event is often used to check the results of the delete operation.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.ItemDeleting>|Occurs when a Delete button is clicked, but before the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control deletes the record from the data source. This event is often used to cancel the delete operation.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.ItemInserted>|Occurs when an Insert button (a button with its `CommandName` property set to \"Insert\") is clicked, but after the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control inserts the record. This event is often used to check the results of the insert operation.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.ItemInserting>|Occurs when an Insert button is clicked, but before the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control inserts the record. This event is often used to cancel the insert operation.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.ItemUpdated>|Occurs when an Update button (a button with its `CommandName` property set to \"Update\") is clicked, but after the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control updates the row. This event is often used to check the results of the update operation.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.ItemUpdating>|Occurs when an Update button is clicked, but before the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control updates the record. This event is often used to cancel the update operation.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.ModeChanged>|Occurs after the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control changes modes (to edit, insert, or read-only mode). This event is often used to perform a task when the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control changes modes.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.ModeChanging>|Occurs before the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control changes modes (to edit, insert, or read-only mode). This event is often used to cancel a mode change.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.PageIndexChanged>|Occurs when one of the pager buttons is clicked, but after the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control handles the paging operation. This event is commonly used when you need to perform a task after the user navigates to a different record in the control.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.PageIndexChanging>|Occurs when one of the pager buttons is clicked, but before the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control handles the paging operation. This event is often used to cancel the paging operation.|  \n  \n<a name=\"accessibility\"></a>   \n## Accessibility  \n For information about how to configure this control so that it generates markup that conforms to accessibility standards, see [Accessibility in Visual Studio and ASP.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/7e3ce9c4-6b7d-4fb1-94b5-72cf2a44fe13) and [ASP.NET Controls and Accessibility](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/847a37e3-ce20-41da-b0d3-7dfb0fdae9a0).  \n  \n<a name=\"applying_styles\"></a>   \n## Applying CSS Styles  \n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control lets you specify CSS style rules in markup. If you use templates to customize the appearance of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control, you can specify CSS styles in the markup in the templates. In that case, no extra outer table is required. You can prevent the table from being rendered by setting the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.RenderOuterTable%2A> property to `false`.  \n  \n<a name=\"declarative_syntax\"></a>   \n##

The <xref href=\"System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView\"></xref> control allows you to edit, delete, and insert records.\n  remarks: \"In this topic:  \\n  \\n-   [Introduction](#introduction)  \\n  \\n-   [Templates](#templates)  \\n  \\n-   [Binding to Data](#binding_to_data)  \\n  \\n-   [Data Operations](#data_operations)  \\n  \\n-   [Customizing the User Interface](#customizing_the_user_interface)  \\n  \\n-   [Events](#events)  \\n  \\n-   [Accessibility](#accessibility)  \\n  \\n-   [Applying CSS Styles](#applying_styles)  \\n  \\n-   [Declarative Syntax](#declarative_syntax)  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"introduction\\\"></a>   \\n## Introduction  \\n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control is used to display a single record from a data source. It is similar to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.DetailsView> control, except it displays user-defined templates instead of row fields. Creating your own templates gives you greater flexibility in controlling how the data is displayed. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control supports the following features:  \\n  \\n-   Binding to data source controls, such as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SqlDataSource> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.ObjectDataSource>.  \\n  \\n-   Built-in inserting capabilities.  \\n  \\n-   Built-in updating and deleting capabilities.  \\n  \\n-   Built-in paging capabilities.  \\n  \\n-   Programmatic access to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> object model to dynamically set properties, handle events, and so on.  \\n  \\n-   Customizable appearance through user-defined templates, themes, and styles.  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"templates\\\"></a>   \\n## Templates  \\n For the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control to display content, you need to create templates for the different parts of the control. Most templates are optional; however, you must create a template for the mode in which the control is configured. For example, a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control that supports inserting records must have an insert item template defined. The following table lists the different templates that you can create.  \\n  \\n|Template type|Description|  \\n|-------------------|-----------------|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.EditItemTemplate%2A>|Defines the content for the data row when the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control is in edit mode. This template usually contains input controls and command buttons with which the user can edit an existing record.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.EmptyDataTemplate%2A>|Defines the content for the empty data row displayed when the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control is bound to a data source that does not contain any records. This template usually contains content to alert the user that the data source does not contain any records.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.FooterTemplate%2A>|Defines the content for the footer row. This template usually contains any additional content you would like to display in the footer row. **Note:**  As an alternative, you can simply specify text to display in the footer row by setting the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.FooterText%2A> property.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.HeaderTemplate%2A>|Defines the content for the header row. This template usually contains any additional content you would like to display in the header row. **Note:**  As an alternative, you can simply specify text to display in the header row by setting the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.HeaderText%2A> property.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.ItemTemplate%2A>|Defines the content for the data row when the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control is in read-only mode. This template usually contains content to display the values of an existing record.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.InsertItemTemplate%2A>|Defines the content for the data row when the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control is in insert mode. This template usually contains input controls and command buttons with which the user can add a new record.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.PagerTemplate%2A>|Defines the content for the pager row displayed when the paging feature is enabled (when the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.AllowPaging%2A> property is set to `true`). This template usually contains controls with which the user can navigate to another record. **Note:**  The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control has a built-in pager row user interface (UI). You need to create a pager template only if you want to create your own custom pager row.|  \\n  \\n To display the value of a field in an item template, use a data binding expression. For more information on data binding expressions, see [Data-Binding Expression Syntax](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/676beb1d-ddfa-4153-bba8-3c86dcb7ceca).  \\n  \\n Input controls in the edit item template and insert item template can be bound to the fields of a data source by using a two-way binding expression. This allows the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control to automatically extract the values of the input control for an update or insert operation. Two-way binding expressions also allow input controls in an edit item template to automatically display the original field values. For more information on two-way binding expressions, see [Binding to Databases](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/ab7b2846-975b-4057-a948-45527497c742).  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"binding_to_data\\\"></a>   \\n## Binding to Data  \\n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control can be bound to a data source control (such as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SqlDataSource>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.ObjectDataSource>, or <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AccessDataSource>) or to any data source collection that implements the <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerable?displayProperty=fullName> interface, such as <xref:System.Data.DataView?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601?displayProperty=fullName>, or other collection types. Use one of the following methods to bind the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control to the appropriate data source type:  \\n  \\n-   To bind to a data source control, set the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.DataBoundControl.DataSourceID%2A> property of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control to the <xref:System.Web.UI.Control.ID%2A> value of the data source control. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control automatically binds to the specified data source control and can take advantage of the data source control's capabilities to perform inserting, updating, deleting, and paging functionality. This is the preferred method to bind to data.  \\n  \\n-   To bind to a data source that implements the <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerable?displayProperty=fullName> interface, programmatically set the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.BaseDataBoundControl.DataSource%2A> property of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control to the data source and then call the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.BaseDataBoundControl.DataBind%2A> method. When using this method, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control does not provide built-in inserting, updating, deleting, and paging functionality. You need to provide this functionality by using the appropriate event.  \\n  \\n For more information on data binding, see [ASP.NET Data Access Content Map](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/f9219396-a0fa-481f-894d-e3d9c67d64f2).  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  This control can be used to display user input, which might include malicious client script. Check any information that is sent from a client for executable script, SQL statements, or other code before displaying it in your application. Whenever possible, it is strongly recommended that values are HTML-encoded before they are displayed in this control. ASP.NET provides an input request validation feature to block script and HTML in user input. Validation server controls are also provided to assess user input. For more information, see [Introduction to the Validation Controls](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/3c0e7514-cff2-4bed-936d-ee3f7b740190).  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"data_operations\\\"></a>   \\n## Data Operations  \\n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control provides many built-in capabilities that allow the user to update, delete, insert, and page through items in the control. When the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control is bound to a data source control, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control can take advantage of the data source control's capabilities and provide automatic updating, deleting, inserting, and paging functionality.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control can provide support for update, delete, insert, and paging operations with other types of data sources; however, you must provide an appropriate event handler with the implementation for these operations.  \\n  \\n Because the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control uses templates, it does not provide a way to automatically generate command buttons to perform updating, deleting, or inserting operations. You must manually include these command buttons in the appropriate template. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control recognizes certain buttons that have their `CommandName` properties set to specific values. The following table lists the command buttons that the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control recognizes.  \\n  \\n|Button|CommandName value|Description|  \\n|------------|-----------------------|-----------------|  \\n|Cancel|\\\"Cancel\\\"|Used in updating or inserting operations to cancel the operation and to discard the values entered by the user. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control then returns to the mode specified by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.DefaultMode%2A> property.|  \\n|Delete|\\\"Delete\\\"|Used in deleting operations to delete the displayed record from the data source. Raises the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.ItemDeleting> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.ItemDeleted> events.|  \\n|Edit|\\\"Edit\\\"|Used in updating operations to put the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control in edit mode. The content specified in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.EditItemTemplate%2A> property is displayed for the data row.|  \\n|Insert|\\\"Insert\\\"|Used in inserting operations to attempt to insert a new record in the data source using the values provided by the user. Raises the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.ItemInserting> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.ItemInserted> events.|  \\n|New|\\\"New\\\"|Used in inserting operations to put the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control in insert mode. The content specified in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.InsertItemTemplate%2A> property is displayed for the data row.|  \\n|Page|\\\"Page\\\"|Used in paging operations to represent a button in the pager row that performs paging. To specify the paging operation, set the `CommandArgument` property of the button to \\\"Next\\\", \\\"Prev\\\", \\\"First\\\", \\\"Last\\\", or the index of the page to which to navigate. Raises the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.PageIndexChanging> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.PageIndexChanged> events. **Note:**  This type of button is typically used only in the pager template.|  \\n|Update|\\\"Update\\\"|Used in updating operations to attempt to update the displayed record in the data source with the values provided by the user. Raises the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.ItemUpdating> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.ItemUpdated> events.|  \\n  \\n Unlike the Delete button (which deletes the displayed record immediately), when the Edit or New button is clicked, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control goes into edit or insert mode, respectively. In edit mode, the content contained in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.EditItemTemplate%2A> property is displayed for the current data item. Typically, the edit item template is defined such that the Edit button is replaced with an Update and a Cancel button. Input controls that are appropriate for the field's data type (such as a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.TextBox> or a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.CheckBox> control) are also usually displayed with a field's value for the user to modify. Clicking the Update button updates the record in the data source, while clicking the Cancel button abandons any changes.  \\n  \\n Likewise, the content contained in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.InsertItemTemplate%2A> property is displayed for the data item when the control is in insert mode. The insert item template is typically defined such that the New button is replaced with an Insert and a Cancel button, and empty input controls are displayed for the user to enter the values for the new record. Clicking the Insert button inserts the record in the data source, while clicking the Cancel button abandons any changes.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control provides a paging feature, which allows the user to navigate to other records in the data source. When enabled, a pager row is displayed in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control that contains the page navigation controls. To enable paging, set the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.AllowPaging%2A> property to `true`. You can customize the pager row by setting the properties of objects contained in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.PagerStyle%2A> and the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.PagerSettings%2A> property. Instead of using the built-in pager row UI, you can create your own UI by using the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.PagerTemplate%2A> property.  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"customizing_the_user_interface\\\"></a>   \\n## Customizing the User Interface  \\n You can customize the appearance of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control by setting the style properties for the different parts of the control. The following table lists the different style properties.  \\n  \\n|Style property|Description|  \\n|--------------------|-----------------|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.EditRowStyle%2A>|The style settings for the data row when the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control is in edit mode.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.EmptyDataRowStyle%2A>|The style settings for the empty data row displayed in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control when the data source does not contain any records.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.FooterStyle%2A>|The style settings for the footer row of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.HeaderStyle%2A>|The style settings for the header row of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.InsertRowStyle%2A>|The style settings for the data row when the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control is in insert mode.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.PagerStyle%2A>|The style settings for the pager row displayed in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control when the paging feature is enabled.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.RowStyle%2A>|The style settings for the data row when the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control is in read-only mode.|  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"events\\\"></a>   \\n## Events  \\n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control provides several events that you can program against. This allows you to run a custom routine whenever an event occurs. The following table lists the events supported by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control.  \\n  \\n|Event|Description|  \\n|-----------|-----------------|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.ItemCommand>|Occurs when a button within a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control is clicked. This event is often used to perform a task when a button is clicked in the control.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.ItemCreated>|Occurs after all <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormViewRow> objects are created in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control. This event is often used to modify the values of a record before it is displayed.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.ItemDeleted>|Occurs when a Delete button (a button with its `CommandName` property set to \\\"Delete\\\") is clicked, but after the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control deletes the record from the data source. This event is often used to check the results of the delete operation.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.ItemDeleting>|Occurs when a Delete button is clicked, but before the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control deletes the record from the data source. This event is often used to cancel the delete operation.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.ItemInserted>|Occurs when an Insert button (a button with its `CommandName` property set to \\\"Insert\\\") is clicked, but after the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control inserts the record. This event is often used to check the results of the insert operation.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.ItemInserting>|Occurs when an Insert button is clicked, but before the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control inserts the record. This event is often used to cancel the insert operation.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.ItemUpdated>|Occurs when an Update button (a button with its `CommandName` property set to \\\"Update\\\") is clicked, but after the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control updates the row. This event is often used to check the results of the update operation.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.ItemUpdating>|Occurs when an Update button is clicked, but before the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control updates the record. This event is often used to cancel the update operation.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.ModeChanged>|Occurs after the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control changes modes (to edit, insert, or read-only mode). This event is often used to perform a task when the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control changes modes.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.ModeChanging>|Occurs before the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control changes modes (to edit, insert, or read-only mode). This event is often used to cancel a mode change.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.PageIndexChanged>|Occurs when one of the pager buttons is clicked, but after the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control handles the paging operation. This event is commonly used when you need to perform a task after the user navigates to a different record in the control.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.PageIndexChanging>|Occurs when one of the pager buttons is clicked, but before the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control handles the paging operation. This event is often used to cancel the paging operation.|  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"accessibility\\\"></a>   \\n## Accessibility  \\n For information about how to configure this control so that it generates markup that conforms to accessibility standards, see [Accessibility in Visual Studio and ASP.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/7e3ce9c4-6b7d-4fb1-94b5-72cf2a44fe13) and [ASP.NET Controls and Accessibility](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/847a37e3-ce20-41da-b0d3-7dfb0fdae9a0).  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"applying_styles\\\"></a>   \\n## Applying CSS Styles  \\n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control lets you specify CSS style rules in markup.

The paging feature can be used with any data source object that supports the <xref:System.Collections.ICollection?displayProperty=fullName> interface or a data source that supports paging capability.  \\n  \\n To enable the paging feature, set the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.AllowPaging%2A> property to `true`. You can determine the total number of items in the underlying data source by using the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.PageCount%2A> property. To determine the index of the currently displayed item, use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.PageIndex%2A> property.  \\n  \\n When paging is enabled, an additional row called the pager row is automatically displayed in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control. The pager row contains the page navigation controls and can be displayed at the top, bottom, or both the top and bottom of the control. The pager row has four built-in pager display modes. The following table describes the four modes.  \\n  \\n|Mode|Description|  \\n|----------|-----------------|  \\n|`PagerButton.NextPrevious`|A set of pagination controls consisting of previous and next buttons.|  \\n|`PagerButton.NextPreviousFirstLast`|A set of pagination controls consisting of previous, next, first, and last buttons.|  \\n|`PagerButton.Numeric`|A set of pagination controls consisting of numbered link buttons to access pages directly.

To control the appearance of the pager row (including its background color and font color), use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.PagerStyle%2A> property. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control also allows you to define a custom template for the pager row. For more information on creating a custom pager row template, see <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView.PagerTemplate%2A>.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView> control provides several events that you can use to perform a custom action when paging occurs.
