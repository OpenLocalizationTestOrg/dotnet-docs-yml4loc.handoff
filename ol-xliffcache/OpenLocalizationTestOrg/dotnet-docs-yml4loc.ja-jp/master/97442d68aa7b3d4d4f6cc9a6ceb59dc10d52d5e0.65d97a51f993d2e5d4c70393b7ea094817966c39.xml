For example, when you print, font subsetting is performed every four pages. Each page must be cached until the subsetting is complete, and then all four <xref:System.Windows.Xps.Packaging.PackagingAction.FixedPageCompleted> events occur at the same time. The resulting <xref:System.Windows.Xps.Packaging.PackagingProgressEventArgs> sets <xref:System.Windows.Xps.Packaging.PackagingProgressEventArgs.Action%2A> to <xref:System.Windows.Xps.Packaging.PackagingAction.FixedPageCompleted> and sets <xref:System.Windows.Xps.Packaging.PackagingProgressEventArgs.NumberCompleted%2A> to 4.  \\n  \\n For example, if a package consists of a single four-page document that uses one font and no images or other resources, the sequence of events might occur as shown in the following table:  \\n  \\n **The sequence of events for a simple package**  \\n  \\n AddingDocumentSequence  \\n 1  \\n  \\n AddingFixedDocument  \\n 1  \\n  \\n AddingFixedPage  \\n 1  \\n  \\n AddingFixedPage  \\n 1  \\n  \\n AddingFixedPage  \\n 1  \\n  \\n AddingFixedPage  \\n 1  \\n  \\n FontAdded  \\n 1  \\n  \\n FixedPageCompleted  \\n 4  \\n  \\n FixedDocumentCompleted  \\n 1  \\n  \\n DocumentSequenceCompleted  \\n 1  \\n  \\n XpsDocumentCommitted  \\n 1\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public int NumberCompleted { get; }\n    return:\n      type: System.Int32\n      description: An <xref href=\"System.Int32\"></xref> that represents the number of simultaneous times that the action that is identified in <xref href=\"System.Windows.Xps.Packaging.PackagingProgressEventArgs.Action\"></xref> has occurred.\n  overload: System.Windows.Xps.Packaging.PackagingProgressEventArgs.NumberCompleted*\n  exceptions: []\n  version:\n  -
