The <xref:System.Tuple%607> class represents a 7-tuple, or septuple, which is a tuple that has seven components.  \\n  \\n You can instantiate a <xref:System.Tuple%607> object by calling either the <xref:System.Tuple%607.%23ctor%2A> or the static <xref:System.Tuple.Create%60%607%28%60%600%2C%60%601%2C%60%602%2C%60%603%2C%60%604%2C%60%605%2C%60%606%29?displayProperty=fullName> method. You can retrieve the value of the tuple's components by using the read-only <xref:System.Tuple%607.Item1%2A>, <xref:System.Tuple%607.Item2%2A>, <xref:System.Tuple%607.Item3%2A>, <xref:System.Tuple%607.Item4%2A>, <xref:System.Tuple%607.Item5%2A>, <xref:System.Tuple%607.Item6%2A>, and <xref:System.Tuple%607.Item7%2A> instance properties.  \\n  \\n Tuples are commonly used in four different ways:  \\n  \\n-   To represent a single set of data. For example, a tuple can represent a database record, and its components can represent individual fields of the record.  \\n  \\n-   To provide easy access to, and manipulation of, a data set. The following example defines a <xref:System.Tuple%607> object that contains population data for New York City for each census from 1950 through 2000. The septuple is passed to the `ComputePopulationChange` method, which calculates the annual rate of change between censuses, as well as the annual rate of change for the entire 60 year period.  \\n  \\n     [!code-csharp[System.Tuple\\\\`7.Class#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.tuple`7.class/cs/example1.cs#1)]\\n     [!code-vb[System.Tuple\\\\`7.Class#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.tuple`7.class/vb/example1.vb#1)]  \\n  \\n-   To return multiple values from a method without the use of `out` parameters (in C#) or `ByRef` parameters (in Visual Basic). For example, the previous example returns its computed statistics, along with the city name, in a <xref:System.Tuple%607> object.  \\n  \\n-   To pass multiple values to a method through a single parameter. For example, the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Start%28System.Object%29?displayProperty=fullName> method has a single parameter that lets you supply one value to the method that the thread executes at startup. If you supply a <xref:System.Tuple%607> object as the method argument, you can supply the thread’s startup routine with seven items of data.\"\n  syntax:\n    content: 'public class Tuple<T1,T2,T3,T4,T5,T6,T7> : IComparable, System.Collections.IStructuralComparable, System.Collections.IStructuralEquatable'\n    typeParameters:\n    - id: T1\n      description: The type of the tuple's first component.\n    - id: T2\n      description: The type of the tuple's second component.\n    - id: T3\n      description: The type of the tuple's third component.\n    - id: T4\n      description: The type of the tuple's fourth component.\n    - id: T5\n      description: The type of the tuple's fifth component.\n    - id: T6\n      description: The type of the tuple's sixth component.\n    - id: T7\n      description: The type of the tuple's seventh component.\n  inheritance:\n  - System.Object\n  implements:\n  - System.Collections.IStructuralComparable\n  - System.Collections.IStructuralEquatable\n  - System.IComparable\n  inheritedMembers:\n  - System.Object.Equals(System.Object,System.Object)\n  - System.Object.GetType\n  - System.Object.MemberwiseClone\n  - System.Object.ReferenceEquals(System.Object,System.Object)\n  extensionMethods:\n  - System.TupleExtensions.Deconstruct``7(System.Tuple{``0,``1,``2,``3,``4,``5,``6},``0@,``1@,``2@,``3@,``4@,``5@,``6@)\n  - System.TupleExtensions.ToValueTuple``7(System.Tuple{``0,``1,``2,``3,``4,``5,``6})\n  version:\n  - netcore-1.0\n  - netcore-1.1\n  - netcore-2.0\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  - netstandard-1.0\n  - netstandard-1.1\n  - netstandard-1.2\n  - netstandard-1.3\n  - netstandard-1.4\n  - netstandard-1.5\n  - netstandard-1.6\n  - netstandard-2.0\n  - xamarinandroid-7.1\n  - xamarinios-10.8\n  - xamarinmac-3.0\n  monikers:\n  - netcore-1.0\n  - netcore-1.1\n  - netcore-2.0\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  - netstandard-1.0\n  - netstandard-1.1\n  - netstandard-1.2\n  - netstandard-1.3\n  - netstandard-1.4\n  - netstandard-1.5\n  - netstandard-1.6\n  - netstandard-2.0\n  - xamarinandroid-7.1\n  - xamarinios-10.8\n  - xamarinmac-3.0\n  content_git_url: https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/xml/System/Tuple`7.xml\n  ms.technology:\n  - dotnet-standard\n  author: rpetrusha\n  ms.author: ronpet\n  manager: wpickett\n- uid: System.Tuple`7.#ctor(`0,`1,`2,`3,`4,`5,`6)\n  commentId: M:System.Tuple`7.#ctor(`0,`1,`2,`3,`4,`5,`6)\n  id: '#ctor(`0,`1,`2,`3,`4,`5,`6)'\n  parent: System.Tuple`7\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: Tuple<T1,T2,T3,T4,T5,T6,T7>(T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7)\n  nameWithType: Tuple<T1,T2,T3,T4,T5,T6,T7>.Tuple<T1,T2,T3,T4,T5,T6,T7>(T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7)\n  fullName: Tuple<T1,T2,T3,T4,T5,T6,T7>.Tuple<T1,T2,T3,T4,T5,T6,T7>(T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7)\n  type: Constructor\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Runtime\n  - mscorlib\n  - netstandard\n  namespace: System\n  summary: Initializes a new instance of the <xref href=\"System.Tuple`7\"></xref> class.\n  remarks: \"You can use the static <xref:System.Tuple.Create%60%607%28%60%600%2C%60%601%2C%60%602%2C%60%603%2C%60%604%2C%60%605%2C%60%606%29?displayProperty=fullName> method to instantiate a 7-tuple object without having to explicitly specify the types of its components.
