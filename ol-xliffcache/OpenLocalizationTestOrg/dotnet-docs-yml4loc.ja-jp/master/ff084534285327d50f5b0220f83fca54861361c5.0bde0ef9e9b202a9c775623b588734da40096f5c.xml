When you create controls that derive from the base <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> class, you get an implementation of all the properties in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebPart> interface, because the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> base class implements this interface.  \\n  \\n You can use existing user controls, ASP.NET controls, or custom server controls that do not inherit from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> class as part of a Web Parts application, and they can also use these UI-oriented properties declared by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebPart> interface. If you place existing server controls in a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> zone, at run time they are wrapped with a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart> object. Because the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart> class inherits from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> base class, it enables existing server controls to act as true <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls and it adds to them the properties of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebPart> interface.  \\n  \\n If you place server controls that are not <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls in zones, they can use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebPart> properties at run time, and you can also declare values for those properties on server controls in the markup of the page (in page persistence format). However, because these properties are only available to the server controls at run time, design-time coding features such as IntelliSense do not recognize <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebPart> properties that are declared on server controls. Declared properties on these controls still work when you load the page, but Microsoft Visual Studio does not recognize the properties as valid at design time. If you want to add the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebPart> properties to existing server and user controls to enhance the design-time user experience, you can implement the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebPart> interface in a server control.  \\n  \\n Perhaps the main reason to implement the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebPart> interface is for controls that do not support the use of expando (custom) properties. Expando properties are strings that can be added to a class dynamically as a property, by means of the <xref:System.Web.UI.IAttributeAccessor> interface. Controls that implement this interface, including the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebControl> class and its children, can use expando properties. Therefore, all ASP.NET server controls, custom controls that derive from them, Web user controls, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls support the use of expando properties. But custom controls that inherit directly from the base <xref:System.Web.UI.Control> class do not support expando properties. Thus, if you declare these controls within a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone>, you will not be able to declare the common <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebPart> properties on the controls, properties such as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebPart.Title%2A> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebPart.Description%2A>. If you want to use these properties with such controls, you must implement the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebPart> interface.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example demonstrates how to implement the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebPart> interface in a user control. This is a simple implementation that shows minimally how to implement the properties.  \\n  \\n The first part of the code example shows the user control. The user control implements all the properties of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebPart> interface, plus two additional public properties tied to controls in the user interface. The two custom properties each use the `Personalizable` attribute, which enables the values in those properties to be saved across browser sessions. Note that in the base <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> class implementation, all the properties of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebPart> interface are implemented as personalizable as well, though they are not in this code example.  \\n  \\n <!-- TODO: review snippet reference [!code-csharp[WebParts_IWebPart_Overview#2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_IWebPart_Overview/CS/accountusercontrolcs.ascx#2)]  -->\\n <!-- TODO: review snippet reference [!code-vb[WebParts_IWebPart_Overview#2](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_IWebPart_Overview/VB/accountusercontrolvb.ascx#2)]  -->  \\n  \\n The second part of the code example shows the Web page that hosts the user control. The page has a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> control, within which the user control is referenced. Notice that several of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebPart> interface's property values are set declaratively in the markup for the user control, which enables it to both behave and appear similar to a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control at design time and run time. If you load the page in a browser, you can use the UI on the page to demonstrate the ability to programmatically change the values of the implemented <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebPart> properties at run time. When you change some of the property values, the changes are not evident on the page, but are visible in the page source (the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebPart.TitleIconImageUrl%2A> property), or are stored in the application's state data (the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebPart.CatalogIconImageUrl%2A> property).  \\n  \\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\n>  This example has a text box that accepts user input, which is a potential security threat. By default, ASP.NET Web pages validate that user input does not include script or HTML elements.

The best way to provide a link to Help for a control is to use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.HelpUrl%2A> property.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example demonstrates declarative and programmatic use of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebPart.TitleUrl%2A> property. The complete source code for the example is found in the Example section of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebPart> class overview.  \\n  \\n The first part of the code example shows how the user control implements the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebPart.TitleUrl%2A> property.  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[WebParts_IWebPart_Overview#7](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_IWebPart_Overview/CS/accountusercontrolcs.ascx#7)]\\n [!code-vb[WebParts_IWebPart_Overview#7](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_IWebPart_Overview/VB/accountusercontrolvb.ascx#7)]  \\n  \\n The second part of the code example demonstrates the method in the user control that programmatically sets the value of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebPart.TitleUrl%2A> property when a user selects the appropriate property name from the radio buttons on the page, sets a new value in the text box, and then clicks the **Update** button.  \\n  \\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\n>  This example has a text box that accepts user input, which is a potential security threat. By default, ASP.NET Web pages validate that user input does not include script or HTML elements.

Note that if you do not provide a URL to a real page, and then a user clicks the link in the title bar, an error message appears.  \\n  \\n <!-- TODO: review snippet reference [!code-csharp[WebParts_IWebPart_Overview#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_IWebPart_Overview/CS/accountuchostcs.aspx#1)]  -->\\n <!-- TODO: review snippet reference [!code-vb[WebParts_IWebPart_Overview#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_IWebPart_Overview/VB/accountuchostvb.aspx#1)]  -->\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public string TitleUrl { get; set; }\n    return:\n      type: System.String\n      description: A string that represents a URL to more information about a <xref href=\"System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart\"></xref> control.
