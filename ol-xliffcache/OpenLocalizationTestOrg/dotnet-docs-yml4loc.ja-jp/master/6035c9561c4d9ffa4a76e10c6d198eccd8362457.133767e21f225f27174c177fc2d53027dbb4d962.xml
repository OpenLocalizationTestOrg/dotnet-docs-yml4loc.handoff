For example, if a control is anchored to the right edge of its container, the distance between the right edge of the control and the right edge of the container remains constant when the container resizes. A control can be anchored to any combination of control edges. If the control is anchored to opposite edges of its container (for example, to the top and bottom), it resizes when the container resizes.

The example anchors the button to the bottom-right corner of the form so it keeps its relative position as the form is resized. Next it sets the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackgroundImage%2A> and resizes the button to the same size as the <xref:System.Drawing.Image>. The example then sets the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.TabStop%2A> to `true` and sets the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.TabIndex%2A> property. Lastly, it adds an event handler to handle the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Click> event of the button. This example assumes you have an <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ImageList> named `imageList1`.  \\n  \\n [!code-cpp[Windows.Forms.Control Properties#3](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/Windows.Forms.Control Properties/CPP/controlproperties.cpp#3)]\\n [!code-csharp[Windows.Forms.Control Properties#3](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/Windows.Forms.Control Properties/CS/controlproperties.cs#3)]\\n [!code-vb[Windows.Forms.Control Properties#3](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/Windows.Forms.Control Properties/VB/controlproperties.vb#3)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: >-\n      [System.Flags]\n\n      public enum AnchorStyles\n  inheritance:\n  -
