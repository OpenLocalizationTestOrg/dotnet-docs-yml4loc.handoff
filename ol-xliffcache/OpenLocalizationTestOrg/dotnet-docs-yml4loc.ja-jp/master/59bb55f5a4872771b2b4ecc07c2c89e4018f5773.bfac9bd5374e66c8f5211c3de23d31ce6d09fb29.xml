This class also provides access to culture-specific instances of the <xref:System.Globalization.DateTimeFormatInfo>, <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo>, <xref:System.Globalization.CompareInfo>, and <xref:System.Globalization.TextInfo> objects. These objects contain the information required for culture-specific operations, such as casing, formatting dates and numbers, and comparing strings. The <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> class is used either directly or indirectly by classes that format, parse, or manipulate culture-specific data, such as <xref:System.String>, <xref:System.DateTime>, <xref:System.DateTimeOffset>, and the numeric types.  \n  \n In this section:  \n  \n [Culture names and identifiers](#CultureNames)   \n [Invariant, neutral, and specific cultures](#Invariant)   \n [Custom cultures](#Custom)   \n [Dynamic culture data](#Dynamic)   \n [The current culture and current UI culture](#Current)   \n [Getting all cultures](#GetAll)   \n [Culture and threads](#Threads)   \n [Culture and application domains](#AppDomain)   \n [Culture and task-based asynchronous operations](#Async)   \n [CultureInfo object serialization](#Serialization)   \n [Control Panel overrides](#CPanel)   \n [Alternate sort orders](#AlternateSort)   \n [Culture and Windows apps](#Windows)  \n  \n<a name=\"CultureNames\"></a>   \n## Culture names and identifiers  \n The <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> class specifies a unique name for each culture, based on RFC 4646. The name is a combination of an ISO 639 two-letter lowercase culture code associated with a language and an ISO 3166 two-letter uppercase subculture code associated with a country or region. In addition, for apps that target [!INCLUDE[net_v40_short](~/includes/net-v40-short-md.md)] or later and are running under Windows 10 or later, culture names that correspond to valid BCP-47 language tags are supported.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  When a culture name is passed to a class constructor or a method such as <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CreateSpecificCulture%2A> or <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo>, its case is not significant.  \n  \n The format for the culture name based on RFC 4646 is *languagecode2*>-*country/regioncode2*, where *languagecode2* is the two-letter language code and *country/regioncode2* is the two-letter subculture code. Examples include ja-JP for Japanese (Japan) and en-US for English (United States). In cases where a two-letter language code is not available, a three-letter code derived from ISO 639-2 is used.  \n  \n Note that some culture names also specify an ISO 15924 script. For example, Cyrl specifies the Cyrillic script and Latn specifies the Latin script. A culture name that includes a script uses the pattern *languagecode2*-*scripttag*-*country/regioncode2*. An example of this type of culture name is uz-Cyrl-UZ for Uzbek (Cyrillic, Uzbekistan). On Windows operating systems before Windows Vista, a culture name that includes a script uses the pattern *languagecode2*-*country/regioncode2*-*scripttag*, for example, uz-UZ-Cyrl for Uzbek (Cyrillic, Uzbekistan).  \n  \n A neutral culture is specified by only the two-letter lowercase language code. For example, fr specifies the neutral culture for French, and de specifies the neutral culture for German.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  There are two culture names that contradict this rule. The cultures Chinese (Simplified), named zh-Hans, and Chinese (Traditional), named zh-Hant, are neutral cultures. The culture names represent the current standard and should be used unless you have a reason for using the older names zh-CHS and zh-CHT.  \n  \n A culture identifier is a standard international numeric abbreviation and has the components necessary to uniquely identify one of the installed cultures. Your application can use predefined culture identifiers or define custom identifiers.  \n  \n Certain predefined culture names and identifiers are used by this and other classes in the <xref:System.Globalization?displayProperty=fullName> namespace. Detailed culture information appears in the [National Language Support (NLS) API Reference](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=200048) at the Go Global Developer Center.  \n  \n Remember that the culture names and identifiers represent only a subset of cultures that can be found on a particular computer. Windows versions or service packs can change the available cultures. Applications add custom cultures using the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder> class. Users add their own custom cultures using the Microsoft Locale Builder tool. Microsoft Locale Builder is written in managed code using the `CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder` class.  \n  \n Several distinct names are closely associated with a culture, notably the names associated with the following class members:  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.ToString%2A?displayProperty=fullName>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Name%2A?displayProperty=fullName>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Globalization.CompareInfo.Name%2A?displayProperty=fullName>  \n  \n<a name=\"Invariant\"></a>   \n## Invariant, neutral, and specific cultures  \n The cultures are generally grouped into three sets: invariant cultures, neutral cultures, and specific cultures.  \n  \n An invariant culture is culture-insensitive. Your application specifies the invariant culture by name using an empty string (\"\") or by its identifier. <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture%2A> defines an instance of the invariant culture. It is associated with the English language but not with any country/region. It is used in almost any method in the `Globalization` namespace that requires a culture.  \n  \n A neutral culture is a culture that is associated with a language but not with a country/region. A specific culture is a culture that is associated with a language and a country/region. For example, fr is the neutral name for the French culture, and fr-FR is the name of the specific French (France) culture. Note that Chinese (Simplified) and Chinese (Traditional) are also considered neutral cultures.  \n  \n Creating an instance of a <xref:System.Globalization.CompareInfo> class for a neutral culture is not recommended because the data it contains is arbitrary. To display and sort data, specify both the language and region. Additionally, the <xref:System.Globalization.CompareInfo.Name%2A> property of a <xref:System.Globalization.CompareInfo> object created for a neutral culture returns only the country and does not include the region.  \n  \n The defined cultures have a hierarchy in which the parent of a specific culture is a neutral culture and the parent of a neutral culture is the invariant culture. The <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Parent%2A> property contains the neutral culture associated with a specific culture. Custom cultures should define the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Parent%2A> property in conformance with this pattern.  \n  \n If the resources for a specific culture are not available in the operating system, the resources for the associated neutral culture are used. If the resources for the neutral culture are not available, the resources embedded in the main assembly are used. For more information on the resource fallback process, see [Packaging and Deploying Resources](~/docs/framework/resources/packaging-and-deploying-resources-in-desktop-apps.md).  \n  \n The list of locales in the Windows API is slightly different from the list of cultures supported by the .NET Framework. If interoperability with Windows is required, for example, through the p/invoke mechanism, the application should use a specific culture that is defined for the operating system. Use of the specific culture ensures consistency with the equivalent Windows locale, which is identified with a locale identifier that is the same as <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.LCID%2A>.  \n  \n A <xref:System.Globalization.DateTimeFormatInfo> or a <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo> can be created only for the invariant culture or for specific cultures, not for neutral cultures.  \n  \n If <xref:System.Globalization.DateTimeFormatInfo.Calendar%2A?displayProperty=fullName> is the <xref:System.Globalization.TaiwanCalendar> but the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentCulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> is not set to zh-TW, then <xref:System.Globalization.DateTimeFormatInfo.NativeCalendarName%2A?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.Globalization.DateTimeFormatInfo.GetEraName%2A?displayProperty=fullName>, and <xref:System.Globalization.DateTimeFormatInfo.GetAbbreviatedEraName%2A?displayProperty=fullName> return an empty string (\"\").  \n  \n<a name=\"Custom\"></a>   \n## Custom cultures  \n In addition to the predefined cultures supported by the Windows operating system and the .NET Framework, the .NET Framework supports three types of custom cultures:  \n  \n-   New cultures that supplement the cultures available in Windows or the .NET Framework. For example, an application could install a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object that represents the fj-FJ (or Fijan (Fiji)) culture on a system.  \n  \n-   Replacement cultures whose properties are different from the properties of the standard cultures supported by Windows and the .NET Framework.  \n  \n-   Standard cultures with user overrides. The user can use the **Region and Language** application in **Control Panel** to customize an existing culture's property values.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  You can use the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder> class to define, save, and register custom cultures that either supplement or replace existing cultures. The <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder.Save%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method creates a Locale Data Markup Language (LDML) file that can be used to install a custom culture on target systems. For step-by step information on using the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder> class to create a new or replacement culture, see the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder> class topic.  \n  \n Because the .NET Framework supports custom cultures, you should consider the following when working with culture-specific data:  \n  \n-   Custom cultures can have values that exceed the ranges of the predefined cultures. For example, some cultures have unusually long month names, unexpected date or time formats, or other unusual data.  \n  \n-   When you display culture-specific data in the user interface, you should respect the user's customizations; for example, the user might want a 24-hour clock or a yyyyMMdd date format.  \n  \n-   Remember that custom cultures override default values. Therefore, you cannot consider culture data to be stable. Country names, number and date formats, and spellings may change in the future. If you want to serialize culture-sensitive data such as date and time strings to be passed to the date and time parsing functions, you should use the invariant culture or a specific .  \n  \n The <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CultureTypes%2A> property value of custom cultures installed on a system includes the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureTypes?displayProperty=fullName> flag, and custom cultures are assigned an <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.LCID%2A> property value of `LOCALE_CUSTOM_UNSPECIFIED` (0x1000, or 4096). Note that, starting with Windows 10, this value is also assigned to system-defined cultures that lack complete cultural data.  \n  \n<a name=\"Dynamic\"></a>   \n## Dynamic culture data  \n Except for the invariant culture, culture data is dynamic. This is true even for the predefined cultures. For example, countries or regions adopt new currencies, change their spellings of words, or change their preferred calendar, and culture definitions change to track this.  Custom cultures are subject to change without notice, and any specific culture might be overridden by a custom replacement culture. Also, as discussed below, an individual user can override cultural preferences. Applications should always obtain culture data at run time.  \n  \n> [!CAUTION]\n>  When saving data, your application should use the invariant culture, a binary format, or a specific culture-independent format. Data saved according to the current values associated with a particular culture, other than the invariant culture, might become unreadable or might change in meaning if that culture changes.  \n  \n<a name=\"Current\"></a>   \n## The current culture and current UI culture  \n Every thread in a .NET Framework application has a current culture and a current UI culture. The current culture determines the formatting conventions for dates, times, numbers, and currency values, the sort order of text, casing conventions, and the ways in which strings are compared. The current UI culture is used to retrieve culture-specific resources at runtime.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  For information on how the current and current UI culture is determined on a per-thread basis, see the  [Culture and threads](#Threads) section. For information on how the current and current UI culture is determined on threads executing in a new application domain, and on threads that cross application domain boundaries, see the [Culture and application domains](#AppDomain) section. For information on how the current  and current is determined on  threads performing task-based asynchronous operations, see the [Culture and task-based asynchronous operations](#Async) section.  \n  \n For more detailed information on the current culture, see the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property topic. For more detailed information on the current UI culture, see the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property topic.  \n  \n### Retrieving the current and current UI cultures  \n You can get a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object that represents the current culture in either of two ways:  \n  \n-   By retrieving the value of the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property.  \n  \n-   By retrieving the value of the [Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture](../Topic/CurrentCulture%20Property.md) property.  \n  \n The following example retrieves both property values, compares them to show that they are equal, and displays the name of the current culture.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Globalization.CultureInfo#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/System.Globalization.CultureInfo/cs/Current1.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[System.Globalization.CultureInfo#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/System.Globalization.CultureInfo/vb/Current1.vb#1)]  \n  \n You can get a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object that represents the current UI culture in either of two ways:  \n  \n-   By retrieving the value of the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property.  \n  \n-   By retrieving the value of the [Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture](../Topic/CurrentUICulture%20Property.md) property.  \n  \n The following example retrieves both property values, compares them to show that they are equal, and displays the name of the current UI culture.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Globalization.CultureInfo#2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/System.Globalization.CultureInfo/cs/CurrentUI1.cs#2)]\n [!code-vb[System.Globalization.CultureInfo#2](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/System.Globalization.CultureInfo/vb/CurrentUI1.vb#2)]  \n  \n### Setting the current and current UI cultures  \n To change the culture and UI culture of a thread, do the following:  \n  \n1.  Instantiate a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object that represents that culture by calling a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> class constructor and passing it the name of the culture. The <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.%23ctor%28System.String%29> constructor instantiates a  <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object that reflects user overrides if the new culture is the same as the current Windows culture.   The <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.%23ctor%28System.String%2CSystem.Boolean%29> constructor allows you to specify whether the newly instantiated <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object reflects user overrides if the new culture is the same as the current Windows culture.  \n  \n2.  Assign the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object to the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentCulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> or<xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentUICulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property. In addition, for apps running on the version 4.6 or later of the desktop .NET Framework, you can also assign the  <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object to the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property.  \n  \n The following example retrieves the current culture. If it is anything other than the French (France) culture, it changes the current culture to French (France). Otherwise, it changes the current culture to French (Luxembourg).  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Globalization.CultureInfo#3](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/System.Globalization.CultureInfo/cs/Change1.cs#3)]\n [!code-vb[System.Globalization.CultureInfo#3](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/System.Globalization.CultureInfo/vb/Change1.vb#3)]  \n  \n The following example retrieves the current culture. If it is anything other the Slovenian (Slovenia) culture, it changes the current culture to Slovenian (Slovenia). Otherwise, it changes the current culture to Croatian (Croatia).  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Globalization.CultureInfo#4](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/System.Globalization.CultureInfo/cs/ChangeUI1.cs#4)]\n [!code-vb[System.Globalization.CultureInfo#4](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/System.Globalization.CultureInfo/vb/ChangeUI1.vb#4)]  \n  \n<a name=\"GetAll\"></a>   \n## Getting all cultures  \n You can retrieve an array specific categories of cultures or of all the cultures available on the local computer by calling the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.GetCultures%2A> method. For example, you can retrieve custom cultures, specific cultures, or neutral cultures either alone or in combination.  \n  \n The following example calls the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.GetCultures%2A> method twice, first with the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureTypes?displayProperty=fullName> enumeration member to retrieve all custom cultures, and then with the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureTypes?displayProperty=fullName> enumeration member to retrieve all replacement cultures.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Globalization.CultureInfo#5](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/System.Globalization.CultureInfo/cs/GetCultures1.cs#5)]\n [!code-vb[System.Globalization.CultureInfo#5](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/System.Globalization.CultureInfo/vb/GetCultures1.vb#5)]  \n  \n<a name=\"Threads\"></a>   \n## Culture and threads  \n When a new application thread is started, its current culture and current UI culture are defined by the current system culture, and not by the current thread culture. The following example illustrates the difference. It sets the current culture and current UI culture of an application thread to the French (France) culture (fr-FR). If the current culture is already fr-FR, the example sets it to the English (United States) culture (en-US). It displays three random numbers as currency values and then creates a new thread, which, in turn, displays three more random numbers as currency values. But as the output from the example shows, the currency values displayed by the new thread do not reflect the formatting conventions of the French (France) culture, unlike the output from the main application thread.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Class.Thread#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.globalization.cultureinfo.class.thread/cs/defaultthread1.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Class.Thread#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.globalization.cultureinfo.class.thread/vb/defaultthread1.vb#1)]  \n  \n In versions of the .NET Framework before the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](~/includes/net-v45-md.md)], the most common way to ensure that the main application thread shares the same culture with all other worker threads is to pass either the name of the application-wide culture or a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object that represents the application-wide culture to a <xref:System.Threading.ParameterizedThreadStart?displayProperty=fullName> delegate. The following example uses this approach to ensure that the currency values displayed by two threads reflect the formatting conventions of the same culture.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Class.Thread#2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.globalization.cultureinfo.class.thread/cs/perthread1.cs#2)]\n [!code-vb[System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Class.Thread#2](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.globalization.cultureinfo.class.thread/vb/perthread1.vb#2)]  \n  \n You can set the culture and UI culture of thread pool threads in a similar manner by calling the <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem%28System.Threading.WaitCallback%2CSystem.Object%29?displayProperty=fullName> method.  \n  \n Starting with the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](~/includes/net-v45-md.md)], you can set the culture and UI culture of all threads in an application domain more directly by assigning a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object that represents that culture to the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentCulture%2A> and <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentUICulture%2A> properties. The following example uses these properties to ensure that all threads in the default application domain share the same culture.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Class.Thread#3](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.globalization.cultureinfo.class.thread/cs/setthreads1.cs#3)]\n [!code-vb[System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Class.Thread#3](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.globalization.cultureinfo.class.thread/vb/setthreads1.vb#3)]  \n  \n> [!WARNING]\n>  Although the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentCulture%2A> and <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentUICulture%2A> properties are static members, they define the default culture and default UI culture only for the application domain that is current at the time these property values are set. For more information, see the next section, [Culture and application domains](#AppDomain).  \n  \n When you assign values to the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentCulture%2A> and <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentUICulture%2A> properties, the culture and UI culture of the threads in the application domain also change if they have not explicitly been assigned a culture. However, these threads reflect the new culture settings only while they execute in the current application domain. If these threads execute in another application domain, their culture becomes the default culture defined for that application domain. As a result, we recommend that you always set the culture of the main application thread, and not rely on the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentCulture%2A> and <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentUICulture%2A> properties to change it.  \n  \n<a name=\"AppDomain\"></a>   \n## Culture and application domains  \n <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentCulture%2A> and <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentUICulture%2A> are static properties that explicitly define a default culture only for the application domain that is current when the property value is set or retrieved. The following example sets the default culture and default UI culture in the default application domain to French (France), and then uses the <xref:System.AppDomainSetup> class and the <xref:System.AppDomainInitializer> delegate to set the default culture and UI culture in a new application domain to Russian (Russia). A single thread then executes two methods in each application domain. Note that the thread's culture and UI culture are not explicitly set; they are derived from the default culture and UI culture of the application domain in which the thread is executing. Note also that the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentCulture%2A> and <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentUICulture%2A> properties return the default <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> values of the application domain that is current when the method call is made.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Class.AppDomain#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.globalization.cultureinfo.class.appdomain/cs/appdomainex1.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Class.AppDomain#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.globalization.cultureinfo.class.appdomain/vb/appdomainex1.vb#1)]  \n  \n For more information about cultures and application domains, see the \"Application Domains and Threads\" section in the  topic.  \n  \n<a name=\"Async\"></a>   \n## Culture and task-based asynchronous operations  \n The [task-based asynchronous programming pattern](~/docs/standard/parallel-programming/task-based-asynchronous-programming.md) uses <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task> and <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task%601> objects to asynchronously execute delegates on thread pool threads. The specific thread on which a particular task runs is not known in advance, but is determined only at runtime.  \n  \n For apps that target the [!INCLUDE[net_v46](~/includes/net-v46-md.md)] or later versions, culture is part of an asynchronous operation's context. In other words, starting with apps that target the [!INCLUDE[net_v46](~/includes/net-v46-md.md)], asynchronous operations by default inherit the values of the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture%2A> and <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture%2A> properties of the thread from which they are launched. If the current culture or current UI culture differs from the system culture, the current culture crosses thread boundaries and becomes the current culture of the thread pool thread that is executing an asynchronous operation.  \n  \n The following example provides a simple illustration. It uses the <xref:System.Runtime.Versioning.TargetFrameworkAttribute> attribute to target the [!INCLUDE[net_v46](~/includes/net-v46-md.md)]. The example defines a <xref:System.Func%601> delegate, `formatDelegate`, that returns some numbers formatted as currency values. The example changes the current system culture to either French (France) or, if French (France) is already the current culture, English (United States). It then:  \n  \n-   Invokes the delegate directly so that it runs synchronously on the main app thread.  \n  \n-   Creates a task that executes the delegate asynchronously on a thread pool thread.  \n  \n-   Creates a task that executes the delegate synchronously on the main app thread by calling the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task.RunSynchronously%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method.  \n  \n As the output from the example shows, when the current culture is changed to French (France), the current culture of the thread from which tasks are invoked asynchronously becomes the current culture for that asynchronous operation.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Class.Async#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.globalization.cultureinfo.class.async/cs/asyncculture1.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Class.Async#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.globalization.cultureinfo.class.async/vb/asyncculture1.vb#1)]  \n  \n For apps that target versions of the .NET Framework prior to the [!INCLUDE[net_v46](~/includes/net-v46-md.md)], or for apps that do not target a particular version of the .NET Framework, the culture of the calling thread is not part of a task's context. Instead, unless one is explicitly defined, the culture of new threads by default is the system culture. The following example, which is identical to the previous example except that it lacks the <xref:System.Runtime.Versioning.TargetFrameworkAttribute> attribute, illustrates this. Because the system culture of the system on which the example executed was English (United States), the culture of the task that executes asynchronously on a thread pool thread is en-US rather than fr-FR.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Class.Async#2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.globalization.cultureinfo.class.async/cs/asyncculture2.cs#2)]\n [!code-vb[System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Class.Async#2](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.globalization.cultureinfo.class.async/vb/asyncculture2.vb#2)]  \n  \n For apps that target versions of the .NET Framework from the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](~/includes/net-v45-md.md)] and later but prior to the [!INCLUDE[net_v46](~/includes/net-v46-md.md)], you can use the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentCulture%2A> and <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentUICulture%2A> properties to ensure that the culture of the calling thread is used in asynchronous tasks that execute on thread pool threads.

However, for apps that target the [!INCLUDE[net_v46](~/includes/net-v46-md.md)] or later, the culture of the calling thread remains part of an asynchronous task's context even if the task crosses app domain boundaries.  \n  \n The following example shows that the calling thread's culture remains the current culture of a task-based asynchronous operation even if the method that the task is executing crosses application domain boundaries. It defines a class, `DataRetriever`, with a single method, `GetFormattedNumber`, that returns a random double-precision floating-point number between 1 and 1,000 formatted as a currency value. A first task is run that simply instantiates a `DataRetriever` instance and calls its `GetFormattedNumber` method. A second task reports its current application domain, creates a new application domain, instantiates a `DataRetriever` instance in the new application domain, and calls its `GetFormattedNumber` method. As the output from the example shows, the current culture has remained the same in the calling thread, the first task, and the second task both when it was executing in the main application domain and the second application domain.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Class.Async#4](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.globalization.cultureinfo.class.async/cs/asyncculture4.cs#4)]\n [!code-vb[System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Class.Async#4](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.globalization.cultureinfo.class.async/vb/asyncculture4.vb#4)]  \n  \n<a name=\"Serialization\"></a>   \n## CultureInfo object serialization  \n When a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object is serialized, all that is actually stored is <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Name%2A> and <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.UseUserOverride%2A>. It is successfully de-serialized only in an environment where that <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Name%2A> has the same meaning. The following three examples show why this is not always the case:  \n  \n-   If the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CultureTypes%2A> property value is <xref:System.Globalization.CultureTypes?displayProperty=fullName>, and if that culture was first introduced in Windows Vista or a later version of the Windows operating system, it is not possible to de-serialize it on Windows XP. Similarly, if the culture was first introduced in Windows XP Service Pack 2, it is not possible to de-serialize it for a Windows XP system on which the culture has not been installed.  \n  \n-   If the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CultureTypes%2A> value is <xref:System.Globalization.CultureTypes?displayProperty=fullName>, and the computer on which it is de-serialized does not have this user custom culture installed, it is not possible to de-serialize it.  \n  \n-   If the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CultureTypes%2A> value is <xref:System.Globalization.CultureTypes?displayProperty=fullName>, and the computer on which it is de-serialized does not have this replacement culture, it de-serializes to the same name, but not all of the same characteristics. For example, if en-US is a replacement culture on computer A, but not on computer B, and if a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object referring to this culture is serialized on computer A and de-serialized on computer B, then none of the custom characteristics of the culture are transmitted. The culture de-serializes successfully, but with a different meaning.  \n  \n<a name=\"CPanel\"></a>   \n## Control Panel overrides  \n The user might choose to override some of the values associated with the current culture of Windows through the regional and language options portion of Control Panel. For example, the user might choose to display the date in a different format or to use a currency other than the default for the culture. In general, your applications should honor these user overrides.  \n  \n If <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.UseUserOverride%2A> is `true` and the specified culture matches the current culture of Windows, the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> uses those overrides, including user settings for the properties of the <xref:System.Globalization.DateTimeFormatInfo> instance returned by the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DateTimeFormat%2A> property, and the properties of the <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo> instance returned by the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.NumberFormat%2A> property. If the user settings are incompatible with the culture associated with the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo>, for example, if the selected calendar is not one of the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.OptionalCalendars%2A>, the results of the methods and the values of the properties are undefined.  \n  \n<a name=\"AlternateSort\"></a>   \n## Alternate sort orders  \n Some cultures support more than one sort order. For example:  \n  \n-   The Spanish (Spain) culture has two sort orders: the default international sort order, and the traditional sort order. When you instantiate a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object with the es-ES culture name, the international sort order is used. When you instantiate a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object with the es-ES-tradnl culture name, the traditional sort order is used.  \n  \n-   The zh-CN (Chinese (Simplified, PRC)) culture supports two sort orders:  by pronunciation (the default) and by stroke count. When you instantiate a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object with the zh-CN culture name, the default sort order is used. When you instantiate a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object with a local identifier of 0x00020804, strings are sorted by stroke count.  \n  \n The following table lists the cultures that support alternate sort orders and the identifiers for the default and alternate sort orders.  \n  \n|Culture name|Culture|Default sort name and identifier|Alternate sort name and identifier|  \n|------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|  \n|es-ES|Spanish (Spain)|International: 0x00000C0A|Traditional: 0x0000040A|  \n|zh-TW|Chinese (Taiwan)|Stroke Count: 0x00000404|Bopomofo: 0x00030404|  \n|zh-CN|Chinese (PRC)|Pronunciation: 0x00000804|Stroke Count: 0x00020804|  \n|zh-HK|Chinese (Hong Kong SAR)|Stroke Count: 0x00000c04|Stroke Count: 0x00020c04|  \n|zh-SG|Chinese (Singapore)|Pronunciation: 0x00001004|Stroke Count: 0x00021004|  \n|zh-MO|Chinese (Macao SAR)|Pronunciation: 0x00001404|Stroke Count: 0x00021404|  \n|ja-JP|Japanese (Japan)|Default: 0x00000411|Unicode: 0x00010411|  \n|ko-KR|Korean (Korea)|Default: 0x00000412|Korean Xwansung - Unicode: 0x00010412|  \n|de-DE|German (Germany)|Dictionary: 0x00000407|Phone Book Sort DIN: 0x00010407|  \n|hu-HU|Hungarian (Hungary)|Default: 0x0000040e|Technical Sort: 0x0001040e|  \n|ka-GE|Georgian (Georgia)|Traditional: 0x00000437|Modern Sort: 0x00010437|  \n  \n<a name=\"Windows\"></a>   \n## Culture and Windows apps  \n In Windows apps, the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture%2A> and <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture%2A> properties are read-only. You can set the current culture and current UI culture by using the Windows [ResourceContext.Languages](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.applicationmodel.resources.core.resourcecontext.languages.aspx) property. The following example uses it to change the application's current culture and current UI culture either to English (United States) or, if the current culture is already English (United States), to French (France). The value of the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture%2A> and <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture%2A> properties are then displayed to a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> control named `block`. As the output from the example shows, both property values reflect the new value of the [ResourceContext.Languages](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.applicationmodel.resources.core.resourcecontext.languages.aspx) property.  \n  \n```csharp  \n  \nResourceContext context = ResourceManager.Current.DefaultContext;  \nvar list = new List<String>();  \nif (CultureInfo.CurrentCulture.Name == \"en-US\")  \n   list.Add(\"fr-FR\");  \nelse  \n   list.Add(\"en-US\");  \n  \ncontext.Languages = list;  \nblock.Text += String.Format(\"\\nThe current culture is {0}\\n\",  \n                            CultureInfo.CurrentCulture);  \nblock.Text += String.Format(\"The current culture UI is {0}\\n\",  \n                            CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture);  \n// The example displays output like the following if run on a system  \n// whose current culture is English (United States):  \n// The current culture is fr-FR  \n// The current UI culture is fr-FR  \n  \n```  \n  \n```  \n  \nDim context As ResourceContext = ResourceManager.Current.DefaultContext  \nDim list As New List(Of String)()  \nIf CultureInfo.CurrentCulture.Name = \"en-US\" Then  \n   list.Add(\"fr-FR\")  \nElse  \n   list.Add(\"en-US\")  \nEnd If  \ncontext.Languages = list  \nblock.Text += String.Format(\"{1}The current culture is {0}{1}\",  \n                            CultureInfo.CurrentCulture, vbCrLf)  \nblock.Text += String.Format(\"The current culture UI is {0}\\n\",  \n                            CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture)  \n' The example displays output Like the following if run on a system  \n' whose current culture Is English (United States):  \n'    The current culture Is fr-FR  \n'    The current UI culture Is fr-FR  \n  \n```","nodes":[{"pos":[2,424],"content":"[!NOTE]\n To view the .NET Framework source code for this type, see the [Reference Source](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/globalization/cultureinfo.cs#e319c6636909012f).

The following example changes the current culture to Portuguese (Brazil) and launches six tasks, each of which displays its thread ID, its task ID, and its current culture. Each of the tasks (and the threads) has inherited the culture of the calling thread.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture#14](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.globalization.cultureinfo.currentculture/cs/Async1.cs#14)]\n     [!code-vb[System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture#14](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.globalization.cultureinfo.currentculture/vb/Async1.vb#14)]  \n  \n     For more information, see the \"Culture and task-based asynchronous operations\" section in the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> topic.  \n  \n-   By calling the Windows `GetUserDefaultLocaleName` function.  \n  \n Note that if you set a specific culture that is different from the system-installed culture or the user's preferred culture, and your application starts multiple threads, the current culture of those threads will be the culture that is returned by the `GetUserDefaultLocaleName` function, unless you assign a culture to the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentCulture%2A> property in the application domain in which the thread is executing.  \n  \n For more information about how the culture of a thread is determined, see the \"Culture and threads\" section in the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> reference page.  \n  \n<a name=\"Getting\"></a>   \n## Getting the Current Culture  \n The <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property is a per-thread setting; that is, each thread can have its own culture.

If you explicitly change a thread's culture in this way, that change persists if the thread crosses application domain boundaries.

Instead, you can set the current thread culture to a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object that does not reflect user overrides in the following ways:  \n  \n-   By calling the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.%23ctor%28System.String%2CSystem.Boolean%29> constructor with a value of `false` for the `useUserOverride` argument.  \n  \n-   By calling the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo%2A> method, which returns a cached, read-only <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object.  \n  \n<a name=\"WindowsAndCurr\"></a>   \n## The Current Culture and Windows apps  \n In Windows apps, the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture%2A> property is read-only.

The objects returned by properties such as <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CompareInfo%2A>, <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DateTimeFormat%2A>, and <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.NumberFormat%2A> also reflect the string comparison and formatting conventions of the invariant culture.  \n  \n Unlike culture-sensitive data, which is subject to change by user customization or by updates to the .NET Framework or the operating system, invariant culture data is stable over time and across installed cultures and cannot be customized by users. This makes the invariant culture particularly useful for operations that require culture-independent results, such as formatting and parsing operations that persist formatted data, or sorting and ordering operations that require that data be displayed in a fixed order regardless of culture.  \n  \n## String Operations  \n You can use the invariant culture for culture-sensitive string operations that are not affected by the conventions of the current thread culture and that are consistent across cultures. For example, you may want sorted data to appear in a fixed order or apply a standard set of casing conventions to strings regardless of the current thread culture. To do this, you pass the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture%2A> object to a method that has a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> parameter, such as <xref:System.String.Compare%28System.String%2CSystem.String%2CSystem.Boolean%2CSystem.Globalization.CultureInfo%29> and <xref:System.String.ToUpper%28System.Globalization.CultureInfo%29>.  \n  \n## Persisting Data  \n The <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture%2A> property can be used to persist data in a culture-independent format. This provides a known format that does not change and that can be used to serialize and deserialize data across cultures. After the data is deserialized, it can be formatted appropriately based on the cultural conventions of the current user.  \n  \n For example, if you choose to persist date and time data in string form, you can pass the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture%2A> object to the <xref:System.DateTime.ToString%28System.String%2CSystem.IFormatProvider%29?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.DateTimeOffset.ToString%28System.IFormatProvider%29?displayProperty=fullName> method to create the string, and you can pass the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture%2A> object to the <xref:System.DateTime.Parse%28System.String%2CSystem.IFormatProvider%29?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.DateTimeOffset.Parse%28System.String%2CSystem.IFormatProvider%2CSystem.Globalization.DateTimeStyles%29?displayProperty=fullName> method to convert the string back to a date and time value. This technique ensures that the underlying date and time values do not change when the data is read or written by users from different cultures.  \n  \n The following example uses the invariant culture to persist a <xref:System.DateTime> value as a string. It then parses the string and displays its value by using the formatting conventions of the French (France) and German (Germany) cultures.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.globalization.cultureinfo.invariantculture/cs/persist1.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.globalization.cultureinfo.invariantculture/vb/persist1.vb#1)]  \n  \n## Security Decisions  \n If you are making a security decision (such as whether to allow access to a system resource) based on the result of a string comparison or a case change, you should not use the invariant culture. Instead, you should perform a case-sensitive or case-insensitive ordinal comparison by calling a method that includes a <xref:System.StringComparison> parameter and supplying either <xref:System.StringComparison?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.StringComparison?displayProperty=fullName> as an argument.

You can browse through the source code online, download the reference for offline viewing, and step through the sources (including patches and updates) during debugging; see [instructions](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/).  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> class provides culture-specific information, such as the language, sublanguage, country/region, calendar, and conventions associated with a particular culture. This class also provides access to culture-specific instances of the <xref:System.Globalization.DateTimeFormatInfo>, <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo>, <xref:System.Globalization.CompareInfo>, and <xref:System.Globalization.TextInfo> objects. These objects contain the information required for culture-specific operations, such as casing, formatting dates and numbers, and comparing strings. The <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> class is used either directly or indirectly by classes that format, parse, or manipulate culture-specific data, such as <xref:System.String>, <xref:System.DateTime>, <xref:System.DateTimeOffset>, and the numeric types.  \\n  \\n In this section:  \\n  \\n [Culture names and identifiers](#CultureNames)   \\n [Invariant, neutral, and specific cultures](#Invariant)   \\n [Custom cultures](#Custom)   \\n [Dynamic culture data](#Dynamic)   \\n [The current culture and current UI culture](#Current)   \\n [Getting all cultures](#GetAll)   \\n [Culture and threads](#Threads)   \\n [Culture and application domains](#AppDomain)   \\n [Culture and task-based asynchronous operations](#Async)   \\n [CultureInfo object serialization](#Serialization)   \\n [Control Panel overrides](#CPanel)   \\n [Alternate sort orders](#AlternateSort)   \\n [Culture and Windows apps](#Windows)  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"CultureNames\\\"></a>   \\n## Culture names and identifiers  \\n The <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> class specifies a unique name for each culture, based on RFC 4646. The name is a combination of an ISO 639 two-letter lowercase culture code associated with a language and an ISO 3166 two-letter uppercase subculture code associated with a country or region. In addition, for apps that target [!INCLUDE[net_v40_short](~/includes/net-v40-short-md.md)] or later and are running under Windows 10 or later, culture names that correspond to valid BCP-47 language tags are supported.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  When a culture name is passed to a class constructor or a method such as <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CreateSpecificCulture%2A> or <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo>, its case is not significant.  \\n  \\n The format for the culture name based on RFC 4646 is *languagecode2*>-*country/regioncode2*, where *languagecode2* is the two-letter language code and *country/regioncode2* is the two-letter subculture code. Examples include ja-JP for Japanese (Japan) and en-US for English (United States). In cases where a two-letter language code is not available, a three-letter code derived from ISO 639-2 is used.  \\n  \\n Note that some culture names also specify an ISO 15924 script. For example, Cyrl specifies the Cyrillic script and Latn specifies the Latin script. A culture name that includes a script uses the pattern *languagecode2*-*scripttag*-*country/regioncode2*. An example of this type of culture name is uz-Cyrl-UZ for Uzbek (Cyrillic, Uzbekistan). On Windows operating systems before Windows Vista, a culture name that includes a script uses the pattern *languagecode2*-*country/regioncode2*-*scripttag*, for example, uz-UZ-Cyrl for Uzbek (Cyrillic, Uzbekistan).  \\n  \\n A neutral culture is specified by only the two-letter lowercase language code. For example, fr specifies the neutral culture for French, and de specifies the neutral culture for German.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  There are two culture names that contradict this rule. The cultures Chinese (Simplified), named zh-Hans, and Chinese (Traditional), named zh-Hant, are neutral cultures. The culture names represent the current standard and should be used unless you have a reason for using the older names zh-CHS and zh-CHT.  \\n  \\n A culture identifier is a standard international numeric abbreviation and has the components necessary to uniquely identify one of the installed cultures. Your application can use predefined culture identifiers or define custom identifiers.  \\n  \\n Certain predefined culture names and identifiers are used by this and other classes in the <xref:System.Globalization?displayProperty=fullName> namespace. Detailed culture information appears in the [National Language Support (NLS) API Reference](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=200048) at the Go Global Developer Center.  \\n  \\n Remember that the culture names and identifiers represent only a subset of cultures that can be found on a particular computer. Windows versions or service packs can change the available cultures. Applications add custom cultures using the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder> class. Users add their own custom cultures using the Microsoft Locale Builder tool. Microsoft Locale Builder is written in managed code using the `CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder` class.  \\n  \\n Several distinct names are closely associated with a culture, notably the names associated with the following class members:  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.ToString%2A?displayProperty=fullName>  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Name%2A?displayProperty=fullName>  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Globalization.CompareInfo.Name%2A?displayProperty=fullName>  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"Invariant\\\"></a>   \\n## Invariant, neutral, and specific cultures  \\n The cultures are generally grouped into three sets: invariant cultures, neutral cultures, and specific cultures.  \\n  \\n An invariant culture is culture-insensitive. Your application specifies the invariant culture by name using an empty string (\\\"\\\") or by its identifier. <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture%2A> defines an instance of the invariant culture. It is associated with the English language but not with any country/region. It is used in almost any method in the `Globalization` namespace that requires a culture.  \\n  \\n A neutral culture is a culture that is associated with a language but not with a country/region. A specific culture is a culture that is associated with a language and a country/region. For example, fr is the neutral name for the French culture, and fr-FR is the name of the specific French (France) culture. Note that Chinese (Simplified) and Chinese (Traditional) are also considered neutral cultures.  \\n  \\n Creating an instance of a <xref:System.Globalization.CompareInfo> class for a neutral culture is not recommended because the data it contains is arbitrary. To display and sort data, specify both the language and region. Additionally, the <xref:System.Globalization.CompareInfo.Name%2A> property of a <xref:System.Globalization.CompareInfo> object created for a neutral culture returns only the country and does not include the region.  \\n  \\n The defined cultures have a hierarchy in which the parent of a specific culture is a neutral culture and the parent of a neutral culture is the invariant culture. The <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Parent%2A> property contains the neutral culture associated with a specific culture. Custom cultures should define the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Parent%2A> property in conformance with this pattern.  \\n  \\n If the resources for a specific culture are not available in the operating system, the resources for the associated neutral culture are used. If the resources for the neutral culture are not available, the resources embedded in the main assembly are used. For more information on the resource fallback process, see [Packaging and Deploying Resources](~/docs/framework/resources/packaging-and-deploying-resources-in-desktop-apps.md).  \\n  \\n The list of locales in the Windows API is slightly different from the list of cultures supported by the .NET Framework. If interoperability with Windows is required, for example, through the p/invoke mechanism, the application should use a specific culture that is defined for the operating system. Use of the specific culture ensures consistency with the equivalent Windows locale, which is identified with a locale identifier that is the same as <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.LCID%2A>.  \\n  \\n A <xref:System.Globalization.DateTimeFormatInfo> or a <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo> can be created only for the invariant culture or for specific cultures, not for neutral cultures.  \\n  \\n If <xref:System.Globalization.DateTimeFormatInfo.Calendar%2A?displayProperty=fullName> is the <xref:System.Globalization.TaiwanCalendar> but the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentCulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> is not set to zh-TW, then <xref:System.Globalization.DateTimeFormatInfo.NativeCalendarName%2A?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.Globalization.DateTimeFormatInfo.GetEraName%2A?displayProperty=fullName>, and <xref:System.Globalization.DateTimeFormatInfo.GetAbbreviatedEraName%2A?displayProperty=fullName> return an empty string (\\\"\\\").  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"Custom\\\"></a>   \\n## Custom cultures  \\n In addition to the predefined cultures supported by the Windows operating system and the .NET Framework, the .NET Framework supports three types of custom cultures:  \\n  \\n-   New cultures that supplement the cultures available in Windows or the .NET Framework. For example, an application could install a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object that represents the fj-FJ (or Fijan (Fiji)) culture on a system.  \\n  \\n-   Replacement cultures whose properties are different from the properties of the standard cultures supported by Windows and the .NET Framework.  \\n  \\n-   Standard cultures with user overrides. The user can use the **Region and Language** application in **Control Panel** to customize an existing culture's property values.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  You can use the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder> class to define, save, and register custom cultures that either supplement or replace existing cultures. The <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder.Save%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method creates a Locale Data Markup Language (LDML) file that can be used to install a custom culture on target systems. For step-by step information on using the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder> class to create a new or replacement culture, see the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder> class topic.  \\n  \\n Because the .NET Framework supports custom cultures, you should consider the following when working with culture-specific data:  \\n  \\n-   Custom cultures can have values that exceed the ranges of the predefined cultures. For example, some cultures have unusually long month names, unexpected date or time formats, or other unusual data.  \\n  \\n-   When you display culture-specific data in the user interface, you should respect the user's customizations; for example, the user might want a 24-hour clock or a yyyyMMdd date format.  \\n  \\n-   Remember that custom cultures override default values. Therefore, you cannot consider culture data to be stable. Country names, number and date formats, and spellings may change in the future. If you want to serialize culture-sensitive data such as date and time strings to be passed to the date and time parsing functions, you should use the invariant culture or a specific .  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CultureTypes%2A> property value of custom cultures installed on a system includes the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureTypes?displayProperty=fullName> flag, and custom cultures are assigned an <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.LCID%2A> property value of `LOCALE_CUSTOM_UNSPECIFIED` (0x1000, or 4096). Note that, starting with Windows 10, this value is also assigned to system-defined cultures that lack complete cultural data.  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"Dynamic\\\"></a>   \\n## Dynamic culture data  \\n Except for the invariant culture, culture data is dynamic. This is true even for the predefined cultures. For example, countries or regions adopt new currencies, change their spellings of words, or change their preferred calendar, and culture definitions change to track this.  Custom cultures are subject to change without notice, and any specific culture might be overridden by a custom replacement culture. Also, as discussed below, an individual user can override cultural preferences. Applications should always obtain culture data at run time.  \\n  \\n> [!CAUTION]\\n>  When saving data, your application should use the invariant culture, a binary format, or a specific culture-independent format. Data saved according to the current values associated with a particular culture, other than the invariant culture, might become unreadable or might change in meaning if that culture changes.  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"Current\\\"></a>   \\n## The current culture and current UI culture  \\n Every thread in a .NET Framework application has a current culture and a current UI culture. The current culture determines the formatting conventions for dates, times, numbers, and currency values, the sort order of text, casing conventions, and the ways in which strings are compared.

If the current culture is already fr-FR, the example sets it to the English (United States) culture (en-US). It displays three random numbers as currency values and then creates a new thread, which, in turn, displays three more random numbers as currency values. But as the output from the example shows, the currency values displayed by the new thread do not reflect the formatting conventions of the French (France) culture, unlike the output from the main application thread.  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Class.Thread#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.globalization.cultureinfo.class.thread/cs/defaultthread1.cs#1)]\\n [!code-vb[System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Class.Thread#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.globalization.cultureinfo.class.thread/vb/defaultthread1.vb#1)]  \\n  \\n In versions of the .NET Framework before the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](~/includes/net-v45-md.md)], the most common way to ensure that the main application thread shares the same culture with all other worker threads is to pass either the name of the application-wide culture or a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object that represents the application-wide culture to a <xref:System.Threading.ParameterizedThreadStart?displayProperty=fullName> delegate.

For more information, see the next section, [Culture and application domains](#AppDomain).  \\n  \\n When you assign values to the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentCulture%2A> and <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentUICulture%2A> properties, the culture and UI culture of the threads in the application domain also change if they have not explicitly been assigned a culture. However, these threads reflect the new culture settings only while they execute in the current application domain. If these threads execute in another application domain, their culture becomes the default culture defined for that application domain. As a result, we recommend that you always set the culture of the main application thread, and not rely on the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentCulture%2A> and <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentUICulture%2A> properties to change it.  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"AppDomain\\\"></a>   \\n## Culture and application domains  \\n <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentCulture%2A> and <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentUICulture%2A> are static properties that explicitly define a default culture only for the application domain that is current when the property value is set or retrieved. The following example sets the default culture and default UI culture in the default application domain to French (France), and then uses the <xref:System.AppDomainSetup> class and the <xref:System.AppDomainInitializer> delegate to set the default culture and UI culture in a new application domain to Russian (Russia). A single thread then executes two methods in each application domain. Note that the thread's culture and UI culture are not explicitly set; they are derived from the default culture and UI culture of the application domain in which the thread is executing. Note also that the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentCulture%2A> and <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentUICulture%2A> properties return the default <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> values of the application domain that is current when the method call is made.  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Class.AppDomain#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.globalization.cultureinfo.class.appdomain/cs/appdomainex1.cs#1)]\\n [!code-vb[System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Class.AppDomain#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.globalization.cultureinfo.class.appdomain/vb/appdomainex1.vb#1)]  \\n  \\n For more information about cultures and application domains, see the \\\"Application Domains and Threads\\\" section in the  topic.  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"Async\\\"></a>   \\n## Culture and task-based asynchronous operations  \\n The [task-based asynchronous programming pattern](~/docs/standard/parallel-programming/task-based-asynchronous-programming.md) uses <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task> and <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task%601> objects to asynchronously execute delegates on thread pool threads. The specific thread on which a particular task runs is not known in advance, but is determined only at runtime.  \\n  \\n For apps that target the [!INCLUDE[net_v46](~/includes/net-v46-md.md)] or later versions, culture is part of an asynchronous operation's context. In other words, starting with apps that target the [!INCLUDE[net_v46](~/includes/net-v46-md.md)], asynchronous operations by default inherit the values of the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture%2A> and <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture%2A> properties of the thread from which they are launched. If the current culture or current UI culture differs from the system culture, the current culture crosses thread boundaries and becomes the current culture of the thread pool thread that is executing an asynchronous operation.  \\n  \\n The following example provides a simple illustration. It uses the <xref:System.Runtime.Versioning.TargetFrameworkAttribute> attribute to target the [!INCLUDE[net_v46](~/includes/net-v46-md.md)]. The example defines a <xref:System.Func%601> delegate, `formatDelegate`, that returns some numbers formatted as currency values. The example changes the current system culture to either French (France) or, if French (France) is already the current culture, English (United States). It then:  \\n  \\n-   Invokes the delegate directly so that it runs synchronously on the main app thread.  \\n  \\n-   Creates a task that executes the delegate asynchronously on a thread pool thread.  \\n  \\n-   Creates a task that executes the delegate synchronously on the main app thread by calling the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task.RunSynchronously%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method.  \\n  \\n As the output from the example shows, when the current culture is changed to French (France), the current culture of the thread from which tasks are invoked asynchronously becomes the current culture for that asynchronous operation.  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Class.Async#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.globalization.cultureinfo.class.async/cs/asyncculture1.cs#1)]\\n [!code-vb[System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Class.Async#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.globalization.cultureinfo.class.async/vb/asyncculture1.vb#1)]  \\n  \\n For apps that target versions of the .NET Framework prior to the [!INCLUDE[net_v46](~/includes/net-v46-md.md)], or for apps that do not target a particular version of the .NET Framework, the culture of the calling thread is not part of a task's context. Instead, unless one is explicitly defined, the culture of new threads by default is the system culture. The following example, which is identical to the previous example except that it lacks the <xref:System.Runtime.Versioning.TargetFrameworkAttribute> attribute, illustrates this. Because the system culture of the system on which the example executed was English (United States), the culture of the task that executes asynchronously on a thread pool thread is en-US rather than fr-FR.  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Class.Async#2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.globalization.cultureinfo.class.async/cs/asyncculture2.cs#2)]\\n [!code-vb[System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Class.Async#2](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.globalization.cultureinfo.class.async/vb/asyncculture2.vb#2)]  \\n  \\n For apps that target versions of the .NET Framework from the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](~/includes/net-v45-md.md)] and later but prior to the [!INCLUDE[net_v46](~/includes/net-v46-md.md)], you can use the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentCulture%2A> and <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentUICulture%2A> properties to ensure that the culture of the calling thread is used in asynchronous tasks that execute on thread pool threads. The following example is identical to the previous example, except that it uses the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentCulture%2A> property to ensure that thread pool threads have the same culture as the main app thread.  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Class.Async#3](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.globalization.cultureinfo.class.async/cs/asyncculture3.cs#3)]\\n [!code-vb[System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Class.Async#3](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.globalization.cultureinfo.class.async/vb/asyncculture3.vb#3)]  \\n  \\n <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentCulture%2A> and <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentUICulture%2A> are per-app domain properties; that is, they establish a default culture for all threads not explicitly assigned a culture in a specific application domain. However, for apps that target the [!INCLUDE[net_v46](~/includes/net-v46-md.md)] or later, the culture of the calling thread remains part of an asynchronous task's context even if the task crosses app domain boundaries.  \\n  \\n The following example shows that the calling thread's culture remains the current culture of a task-based asynchronous operation even if the method that the task is executing crosses application domain boundaries. It defines a class, `DataRetriever`, with a single method, `GetFormattedNumber`, that returns a random double-precision floating-point number between 1 and 1,000 formatted as a currency value. A first task is run that simply instantiates a `DataRetriever` instance and calls its `GetFormattedNumber` method. A second task reports its current application domain, creates a new application domain, instantiates a `DataRetriever` instance in the new application domain, and calls its `GetFormattedNumber` method. As the output from the example shows, the current culture has remained the same in the calling thread, the first task, and the second task both when it was executing in the main application domain and the second application domain.  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Class.Async#4](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.globalization.cultureinfo.class.async/cs/asyncculture4.cs#4)]\\n [!code-vb[System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Class.Async#4](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.globalization.cultureinfo.class.async/vb/asyncculture4.vb#4)]  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"Serialization\\\"></a>   \\n## CultureInfo object serialization  \\n When a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object is serialized, all that is actually stored is <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Name%2A> and <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.UseUserOverride%2A>. It is successfully de-serialized only in an environment where that <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Name%2A> has the same meaning. The following three examples show why this is not always the case:  \\n  \\n-   If the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CultureTypes%2A> property value is <xref:System.Globalization.CultureTypes?displayProperty=fullName>, and if that culture was first introduced in Windows Vista or a later version of the Windows operating system, it is not possible to de-serialize it on Windows XP. Similarly, if the culture was first introduced in Windows XP Service Pack 2, it is not possible to de-serialize it for a Windows XP system on which the culture has not been installed.  \\n  \\n-   If the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CultureTypes%2A> value is <xref:System.Globalization.CultureTypes?displayProperty=fullName>, and the computer on which it is de-serialized does not have this user custom culture installed, it is not possible to de-serialize it.  \\n  \\n-   If the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CultureTypes%2A> value is <xref:System.Globalization.CultureTypes?displayProperty=fullName>, and the computer on which it is de-serialized does not have this replacement culture, it de-serializes to the same name, but not all of the same characteristics. For example, if en-US is a replacement culture on computer A, but not on computer B, and if a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object referring to this culture is serialized on computer A and de-serialized on computer B, then none of the custom characteristics of the culture are transmitted. The culture de-serializes successfully, but with a different meaning.  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"CPanel\\\"></a>   \\n## Control Panel overrides  \\n The user might choose to override some of the values associated with the current culture of Windows through the regional and language options portion of Control Panel. For example, the user might choose to display the date in a different format or to use a currency other than the default for the culture. In general, your applications should honor these user overrides.  \\n  \\n If <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.UseUserOverride%2A> is `true` and the specified culture matches the current culture of Windows, the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> uses those overrides, including user settings for the properties of the <xref:System.Globalization.DateTimeFormatInfo> instance returned by the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DateTimeFormat%2A> property, and the properties of the <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo> instance returned by the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.NumberFormat%2A> property. If the user settings are incompatible with the culture associated with the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo>, for example, if the selected calendar is not one of the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.OptionalCalendars%2A>, the results of the methods and the values of the properties are undefined.  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"AlternateSort\\\"></a>   \\n## Alternate sort orders  \\n Some cultures support more than one sort order. For example:  \\n  \\n-   The Spanish (Spain) culture has two sort orders: the default international sort order, and the traditional sort order. When you instantiate a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object with the es-ES culture name, the international sort order is used. When you instantiate a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object with the es-ES-tradnl culture name, the traditional sort order is used.  \\n  \\n-   The zh-CN (Chinese (Simplified, PRC)) culture supports two sort orders:  by pronunciation (the default) and by stroke count. When you instantiate a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object with the zh-CN culture name, the default sort order is used. When you instantiate a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object with a local identifier of 0x00020804, strings are sorted by stroke count.  \\n  \\n The following table lists the cultures that support alternate sort orders and the identifiers for the default and alternate sort orders.  \\n  \\n|Culture name|Culture|Default sort name and identifier|Alternate sort name and identifier|  \\n|------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|  \\n|es-ES|Spanish (Spain)|International: 0x00000C0A|Traditional: 0x0000040A|  \\n|zh-TW|Chinese (Taiwan)|Stroke Count: 0x00000404|Bopomofo: 0x00030404|  \\n|zh-CN|Chinese (PRC)|Pronunciation: 0x00000804|Stroke Count: 0x00020804|  \\n|zh-HK|Chinese (Hong Kong SAR)|Stroke Count: 0x00000c04|Stroke Count: 0x00020c04|  \\n|zh-SG|Chinese (Singapore)|Pronunciation: 0x00001004|Stroke Count: 0x00021004|  \\n|zh-MO|Chinese (Macao SAR)|Pronunciation: 0x00001404|Stroke Count: 0x00021404|  \\n|ja-JP|Japanese (Japan)|Default: 0x00000411|Unicode: 0x00010411|  \\n|ko-KR|Korean (Korea)|Default: 0x00000412|Korean Xwansung - Unicode: 0x00010412|  \\n|de-DE|German (Germany)|Dictionary: 0x00000407|Phone Book Sort DIN: 0x00010407|  \\n|hu-HU|Hungarian (Hungary)|Default: 0x0000040e|Technical Sort: 0x0001040e|  \\n|ka-GE|Georgian (Georgia)|Traditional: 0x00000437|Modern Sort: 0x00010437|  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"Windows\\\"></a>   \\n## Culture and Windows apps  \\n In Windows apps, the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture%2A> and <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture%2A> properties are read-only. You can set the current culture and current UI culture by using the Windows [ResourceContext.Languages](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.applicationmodel.resources.core.resourcecontext.languages.aspx) property. The following example uses it to change the application's current culture and current UI culture either to English (United States) or, if the current culture is already English (United States), to French (France). The value of the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture%2A> and <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture%2A> properties are then displayed to a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> control named `block`. As the output from the example shows, both property values reflect the new value of the [ResourceContext.Languages](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.applicationmodel.resources.core.resourcecontext.languages.aspx) property.  \\n  \\n```csharp  \\n  \\nResourceContext context = ResourceManager.Current.DefaultContext;

If the user settings are incompatible with the culture associated with the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo>, for example, if the selected calendar is not one of the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.OptionalCalendars%2A>, the results of the methods and the values of the properties are undefined.  \\n  \\n Otherwise, this constructor creates a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> that uses the default values for the specified culture.  \\n  \\n The value of the `useUserOverride` parameter becomes the value of the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.UseUserOverride%2A> property.  \\n  \\n For example, suppose that Arabic (Saudi Arabia) is the current culture of Windows and the user changed the calendar from Hijri to Gregorian.  \\n  \\n-   With `CultureInfo(\\\"ar-SA\\\", true)`, <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Calendar%2A> is set to <xref:System.Globalization.GregorianCalendar> (which is the user setting) and <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.UseUserOverride%2A> is set to `true`.  \\n  \\n-   With `CultureInfo(\\\"ar-SA\\\", false)`, <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Calendar%2A> is set to <xref:System.Globalization.HijriCalendar> (which is the default calendar for ar-SA) and <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.UseUserOverride%2A> is set to `false`.  \\n  \\n-   With `CultureInfo(\\\"th-TH\\\", true)`, <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Calendar%2A> is set to <xref:System.Globalization.ThaiBuddhistCalendar> (which is the default calendar for th-TH) and <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.UseUserOverride%2A> is set to `true`.  \\n  \\n-   With `CultureInfo(\\\"th-TH\\\", false)`, <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Calendar%2A> is set to <xref:System.Globalization.ThaiBuddhistCalendar> (which is the default calendar for th-TH) and <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.UseUserOverride%2A> is set to `false`.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.LCID%2A> property of the new <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> is set to the culture identifier associated with the specified name.  \\n  \\n For cultures that use the euro, the .NET Framework and Windows XP set the default currency as euro. However, older versions of Windows do not do this. Therefore, if the user of an older version of Windows has not changed the currency setting through the regional and language options portion of Control Panel, the currency might be incorrect. To use the .NET Framework default setting for the currency, the application should set the `useUserOverride` parameter to `false`.\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public CultureInfo (string name, bool useUserOverride);\n    parameters:\n    - id: name\n      type: System.String\n      description: A predefined <xref href=\"System.Globalization.CultureInfo\"></xref> name, <xref href=\"System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Name\"></xref> of an existing <xref href=\"System.Globalization.CultureInfo\"></xref>, or Windows-only culture name. <code>name</code> is not case-sensitive.\n    - id: useUserOverride\n      type: System.Boolean\n      description: A Boolean that denotes whether to use the user-selected culture settings (`true`) or the default culture settings (`false`).\n  overload: System.Globalization.CultureInfo.#ctor*\n  exceptions:\n  - type: System.ArgumentNullException\n    commentId: T:System.ArgumentNullException\n    description: <code>name</code> is null.\n  - type: System.Globalization.CultureNotFoundException\n    commentId: T:System.Globalization.CultureNotFoundException\n    description: <code>name</code> is not a valid culture name.

You get the UI culture of the current thread by retrieving the value of the   <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property, as the following example illustrates.  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture#5](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.globalization.cultureinfo.currentuiculture/cs/Get1.cs#5)]\\n [!code-vb[System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture#5](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.globalization.cultureinfo.currentuiculture/vb/Get1.vb#5)]  \\n  \\n You can also retrieve the value of the current thread's UI culture from the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentUICulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property.  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"Explicit\\\"></a>   \\n## Explicitly Setting the Current UI Culture  \\n Starting with the [!INCLUDE[net_v46](~/includes/net-v46-md.md)], you can change the current UI culture by assigning a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object that represents the new culture to the i<xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property. The current UI culture can be set to either a specific culture (such as en-US or de-DE) or to a neutral culture (such as en or de). The following example sets the current UI culture to fr-FR or French (France).  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.globalization.cultureinfo.currentuiculture/cs/currentuiculture1.cs#1)]\\n [!code-vb[System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.globalization.cultureinfo.currentuiculture/vb/currentuiculture1.vb#1)]  \\n  \\n In a multithreaded application, you can explicitly set the UI culture of any thread by assigning a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object that represents that culture to the thread's <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentUICulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property. If the thread whose culture you want to set is the current thread, you can assign the new culture to the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property. When the UI culture of a thread is set explicitly, that thread retains the same culture even if it crosses application domain boundaries and executes code in another application domain.  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"Implicit\\\"></a>   \\n## Implicitly Setting the Current UI Culture  \\n When a thread, including the main application thread, is first created, by default its current UI culture is set as follows:  \\n  \\n-   By using the culture defined by the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentUICulture%2A> property for the current application domain if the  property value is not `null`.  \\n  \\n-   By using the system's default culture. On systems that use the Windows operating system, the common language runtime calls the Windows `GetUserDefaultUILanguage` function to set the current  UI culture. `GetUserDefaultUILanguage` returns the default UI culture set by the user. If the user has not set a default UI language, it returns the culture originally installed on the system.  \\n  \\n If the thread crosses application boundaries and executes code in another application domain, its culture is determined in the same way as that of a newly created thread.  \\n  \\n Note that if you set a specific UI culture that is different from the system-installed UI culture or the user's preferred UI culture, and your application starts multiple threads, the current UI culture of those threads will be the culture returned by the `GetUserDefaultUILanguage` function, unless you assign a culture to the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentUICulture%2A> property in the application domain in which the thread is executing.  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"Security\\\"></a>   \\n## Security Considerations  \\n Changing the culture of the current thread requires a <xref:System.Security.Permissions.SecurityPermission> permission with the <xref:System.Security.Permissions.SecurityPermissionFlag.ControlThread> value set.  \\n  \\n> [!CAUTION]\\n>  Manipulating threads is dangerous because of the security state associated with threads. Therefore, this permission should be given only to trustworthy code, and then only as necessary. You cannot change thread culture in semi-trusted code.  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"WindowsAndCurrUI\\\"></a>   \\n## The Current UI Culture and Windows apps  \\n In Windows apps, the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture%2A> property is read-only. You can set the current UI culture by using the Windows [ResourceContext.Languages](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.applicationmodel.resources.core.resourcecontext.languages.aspx) property. The following example uses it to change the application's current UI culture either to English (United States) or, if the current culture is already English (United States), to French (France). The value of the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture%2A> and <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture%2A> properties are then displayed to a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> control named `block`. As the output from the example shows, the current UI culture changes when the [ResourceContext.Languages](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.applicationmodel.resources.core.resourcecontext.languages.aspx) property changes.  \\n  \\n```csharp  \\n  \\nResourceContext context = ResourceManager.Current.DefaultContext;  \\nvar list = new List<String>();  \\nif (CultureInfo.CurrentCulture.Name == \\\"en-US\\\")  \\n   list.Add(\\\"fr-FR\\\");  \\nelse  \\n   list.Add(\\\"en-US\\\");  \\n  \\ncontext.Languages = list;  \\nblock.Text += String.Format(\\\"\\\\nThe current culture is {0}\\\\n\\\",  \\n                            CultureInfo.CurrentCulture);  \\nblock.Text += String.Format(\\\"The current culture UI is {0}\\\\n\\\",  \\n                            CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture);  \\n// The example displays output like the following if run on a system  \\n// whose current culture is English (United States):  \\n// The current culture is fr-FR  \\n// The current UI culture is fr-FR  \\n  \\n```  \\n  \\n```  \\n  \\nDim context As ResourceContext = ResourceManager.Current.DefaultContext  \\nDim list As New List(Of String)()  \\nIf CultureInfo.CurrentCulture.Name = \\\"en-US\\\" Then  \\n   list.Add(\\\"fr-FR\\\")  \\nElse  \\n   list.Add(\\\"en-US\\\")  \\nEnd If  \\ncontext.Languages = list  \\nblock.Text += String.Format(\\\"{1}The current culture is {0}{1}\\\",  \\n                            CultureInfo.CurrentCulture, vbCrLf)  \\nblock.Text += String.Format(\\\"The current culture UI is {0}\\\\n\\\",  \\n                            CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture)  \\n' The example displays output Like the following if run on a system  \\n' whose current culture Is English (United States):  \\n'    The current culture Is fr-FR  \\n'    The current UI culture Is fr-FR  \\n  \\n```\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example demonstrates how to change the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture%2A> and <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture%2A> of the current thread.  \\n  \\n [!code-cpp[System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture2#11](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture2/CPP/currentculture.cpp#11)]\\n [!code-csharp[System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture2#11](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture2/CS/currentculture.cs#11)]\\n [!code-vb[System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture2#11](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture2/VB/currentculture.vb#11)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public static System.Globalization.CultureInfo CurrentUICulture { get; set; }\n    return:\n      type: System.Globalization.CultureInfo\n      description: The culture used by the Resource Manager to look up culture-specific resources at run time.\n  overload: System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture*\n  exceptions:\n  - type: System.ArgumentNullException\n    commentId: T:System.ArgumentNullException\n    description: The property is set to `null`.\n  - type: System.ArgumentException\n    commentId: T:System.ArgumentException\n    description: The property is set to a culture name that cannot be used to locate a resource file.

Windows applications, which have a graphical user interface, support bidirectional languages. However, console applications, which employ the text user interface of the operating system console, do not provide bidirectional support. Therefore, if you localize a console application to Arabic or Hebrew, your application displays unreadable text on the console screen.  \\n  \\n The user interface culture specifies the resources an application needs to support user input and output, and by default is the same as the operating system culture. For example, the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property returns an Arabic culture for an Arabic operating system. Use the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.GetConsoleFallbackUICulture%2A> method to retrieve a culture suitable for a console application user interface. After your application retrieves the fallback user interface culture, it should assign the culture to the current user interface culture of the current thread.

You specify the invariant culture by name by using an empty string (\\\"\\\") in the call to a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> instantiation method. <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> also retrieves an instance of the invariant culture. It can be used in almost any method in the <xref:System.Globalization> namespace that requires a culture. The objects returned by properties such as <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CompareInfo%2A>, <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DateTimeFormat%2A>, and <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.NumberFormat%2A> also reflect the string comparison and formatting conventions of the invariant culture.  \\n  \\n Unlike culture-sensitive data, which is subject to change by user customization or by updates to the .NET Framework or the operating system, invariant culture data is stable over time and across installed cultures and cannot be customized by users. This makes the invariant culture particularly useful for operations that require culture-independent results, such as formatting and parsing operations that persist formatted data, or sorting and ordering operations that require that data be displayed in a fixed order regardless of culture.  \\n  \\n## String Operations  \\n You can use the invariant culture for culture-sensitive string operations that are not affected by the conventions of the current thread culture and that are consistent across cultures. For example, you may want sorted data to appear in a fixed order or apply a standard set of casing conventions to strings regardless of the current thread culture. To do this, you pass the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture%2A> object to a method that has a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> parameter, such as <xref:System.String.Compare%28System.String%2CSystem.String%2CSystem.Boolean%2CSystem.Globalization.CultureInfo%29> and <xref:System.String.ToUpper%28System.Globalization.CultureInfo%29>.  \\n  \\n## Persisting Data  \\n The <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture%2A> property can be used to persist data in a culture-independent format. This provides a known format that does not change and that can be used to serialize and deserialize data across cultures. After the data is deserialized, it can be formatted appropriately based on the cultural conventions of the current user.  \\n  \\n For example, if you choose to persist date and time data in string form, you can pass the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture%2A> object to the <xref:System.DateTime.ToString%28System.String%2CSystem.IFormatProvider%29?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.DateTimeOffset.ToString%28System.IFormatProvider%29?displayProperty=fullName> method to create the string, and you can pass the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture%2A> object to the <xref:System.DateTime.Parse%28System.String%2CSystem.IFormatProvider%29?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.DateTimeOffset.Parse%28System.String%2CSystem.IFormatProvider%2CSystem.Globalization.DateTimeStyles%29?displayProperty=fullName> method to convert the string back to a date and time value. This technique ensures that the underlying date and time values do not change when the data is read or written by users from different cultures.  \\n  \\n The following example uses the invariant culture to persist a <xref:System.DateTime> value as a string. It then parses the string and displays its value by using the formatting conventions of the French (France) and German (Germany) cultures.  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.globalization.cultureinfo.invariantculture/cs/persist1.cs#1)]\\n [!code-vb[System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.globalization.cultureinfo.invariantculture/vb/persist1.vb#1)]  \\n  \\n## Security Decisions  \\n If you are making a security decision (such as whether to allow access to a system resource) based on the result of a string comparison or a case change, you should not use the invariant culture. Instead, you should perform a case-sensitive or case-insensitive ordinal comparison by calling a method that includes a <xref:System.StringComparison> parameter and supplying either <xref:System.StringComparison?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.StringComparison?displayProperty=fullName> as an argument. Code that performs culture-sensitive string operations can cause security vulnerabilities if the current culture is changed or if the culture on the computer that is running the code differs from the culture that is used to test the code.
