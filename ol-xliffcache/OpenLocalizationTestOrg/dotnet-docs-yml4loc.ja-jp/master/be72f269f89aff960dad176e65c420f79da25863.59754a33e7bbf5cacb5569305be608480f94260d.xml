If either or both of these core services are missing, the workflow run-time engine supplies the appropriate default service: <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Hosting.DefaultWorkflowCommitWorkBatchService> for the workflow `CommitWorkBatch` service and <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Hosting.DefaultWorkflowSchedulerService> for the scheduler service. A persistence service is optional, but there can be at most only one persistence service present. After it has validated the service configuration, <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.WorkflowRuntime.StartRuntime%2A> calls <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Hosting.WorkflowRuntimeService.Start%2A> on all of the services that are derived from the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Hosting.WorkflowRuntimeService> class.  Finally, the workflow run-time engine sets <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.WorkflowRuntime.IsStarted%2A> and raises the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.WorkflowRuntime.Started> event.  \\n  \\n You cannot add or remove core services after the workflow run-time engine is started. Core services are services that derive from the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Hosting.WorkflowSchedulerService> class, the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Hosting.WorkflowCommitWorkBatchService> class, the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Hosting.WorkflowPersistenceService> class, or the <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.TrackingService> class.  If you call <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.WorkflowRuntime.StartRuntime%2A> while the workflow run-time engine is running, no action is performed.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example demonstrates how to use <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.WorkflowRuntime> functionality from a workflow host.
