Represents a 6-tuple, or sextuple.\n  remarks: \"A tuple is a data structure that has a specific number and sequence of values. The <xref:System.Tuple%606> class represents a 6-tuple, or sextuple, which is a tuple that has six components.  \\n  \\n You can instantiate a <xref:System.Tuple%606> object by calling either the <xref:System.Tuple%606.%23ctor%2A> or the static  <xref:System.Tuple.Create%60%606%28%60%600%2C%60%601%2C%60%602%2C%60%603%2C%60%604%2C%60%605%29?displayProperty=fullName> method. You can retrieve the value of the tuple's components by using the read-only <xref:System.Tuple%606.Item1%2A>, <xref:System.Tuple%606.Item2%2A>, <xref:System.Tuple%606.Item3%2A>, <xref:System.Tuple%606.Item4%2A>, <xref:System.Tuple%606.Item5%2A>, and <xref:System.Tuple%606.Item6%2A> instance properties.  \\n  \\n Tuples are commonly used in four different ways:  \\n  \\n-   To represent a single set of data. For example, a tuple can represent a database record, and its components can represent individual fields of the record.  \\n  \\n-   To provide easy access to, and manipulation of, a data set. The following example defines a <xref:System.Tuple%606> object that contains population data for New York City for each census from 1960 through 2000. The sextuple is passed to the `ComputePopulationChange` method, which calculates the annual rate of change between censuses, as well as the annual rate of change for the entire 50 year period.  \\n  \\n     [!code-csharp[System.Tuple\\\\`6.Class#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.tuple`6.class/cs/example1.cs#1)]\\n     [!code-vb[System.Tuple\\\\`6.Class#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.tuple`6.class/vb/example1.vb#1)]  \\n  \\n-   To return multiple values from a method without the use of `out` parameters (in C#) or `ByRef` parameters (in Visual Basic). For example, the previous example returns its computed statistics, along with the city name, in a <xref:System.Tuple%606> object.  \\n  \\n-   To pass multiple values to a method through a single parameter. For example, the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Start%28System.Object%29?displayProperty=fullName> method has a single parameter that lets you supply one value to the method that the thread executes at startup.
