There are three ways to form a connection between server controls: declaring a connection in a Web page, creating a connection in code, or adding a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone> control to the page so that users can connect the controls on demand. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone> control generates a UI that enables users to connect or disconnect any server controls on a page that meet the conditions necessary to form a connection. It is an optional control that is not necessary to form connections, but is useful in the case where you want to give users control over which server controls are connected or disconnected.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone> control is one of the Web Parts tool zone controls that inherit from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ToolZone> base class. As a tool zone, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone> control is designed to be visible only when its Web page is in a certain display mode. In this case, the display mode is named connect mode (a page is in this mode when the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control on the page has its <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DisplayMode%2A> property value set to <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.ConnectDisplayMode>). After users switch a page into connect mode, they must click a connect verb on the verbs menu of one of the server controls, and then the connection UI becomes visible.  \n  \n As a Web Parts zone control, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone> control is a type of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> zone (which inherits from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.CompositeControl> class) designed to contain other controls. In general, a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone> zone has most of the same elements as other Web Parts tool zones: a header, a body or contents area, and a footer. For a complete discussion of what a Web Parts zone is, and the different parts of a zone, see the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> class overview.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  Unlike most other Web Parts zones, it is important to note that a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone> zone does not contain a unique type of server control associated with it. For a list of zones and the associated controls they contain, see the chart in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> class overview. But the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone> zone does not contain <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnection> controls. Instead, it serves a very limited purpose of providing a UI for users to connect or disconnect server controls that exist in some <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> zone on the page. The only controls contained in a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone> control are the standard ASP.NET server controls that it generates as part of its UI for forming connections.  \n  \n When the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone> control is rendered, it generates a UI based on the server controls on the page that are capable of forming connections. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone> control determines which server controls in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> zone on the page are providers, which are consumers, which connection points are available, and whether the server controls are currently connected or disconnected, and then it generates the UI accordingly.  \n  \n For example, suppose there is one <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control capable of being a provider, one <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control capable of being a consumer, they are declared in a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> on the page, and they are currently disconnected. When a user switches the page to connect mode and clicks the connect verb on one of the controls, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone> control generates a UI with a link that, when clicked, displays a form in which users can choose options to create a connection. (If the controls were previously connected, the initial view instead presents users with a button to disconnect the controls). In the connection UI for creating new connections, users are shown which control is a provider, and which control is a consumer. A drop-down list control appears below each server control, listing the available <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionPoint> objects for the control. From the respective drop-down lists, users must select one <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ProviderConnectionPoint> object for the provider (to determine what interface and data will be shared with consumers), and one <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConsumerConnectionPoint> object for each consumer (to determine what interface and data the consumer will consume) that will be connected to the provider.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  In the Web Parts control set default implementation, one provider can connect to many consumers, but a consumer can have only one provider.  \n  \n To use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone> control, you can declare it within the `<form>` element on a Web page (but not nested within another Web Parts zone element), using the `<asp:connectionszone>` element, or you can add it to the page programmatically. If you declare the element in a page, unlike the other Web Parts zones, you cannot declare any other type of server controls between the tags of the `<asp:connectionszone>` element. You can declare elements within it that relate to its own properties and style details, but it is a standalone element and is not a template control within which other server controls can be declared.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  To improve accessibility, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone> control is rendered within a `<fieldset>` element. The `<fieldset>` element groups the related set of controls used for establishing connections in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone> control, and it facilitates tabbed navigation among those controls for both visual user agents (such as ordinary Web browsers) and speech-oriented user agents (such as screen-reading software).  \n  \n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone> control has a number of properties it uses for rendering the connection UI. One set of properties includes several verbs--used only in relation to connections--that carry out actions in the UI: <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.ConfigureVerb%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.ConnectVerb%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.DisconnectVerb%2A>. A large set of properties, used especially for the connections zone UI, consists of text strings displayed at various places (or in certain situations, such as when errors occur) in the UI: <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.ConfigureConnectionTitle%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.ConnectToConsumerInstructionText%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.ConnectToConsumerText%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.ConnectToConsumerTitle%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.ConnectToProviderInstructionText%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.ConnectToProviderText%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.ConnectToProviderTitle%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.ConsumersInstructionText%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.ConsumersTitle%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.ExistingConnectionErrorMessage%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.GetFromText%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.GetText%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.InstructionTitle%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.NewConnectionErrorMessage%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.NoExistingConnectionInstructionText%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.NoExistingConnectionTitle%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.ProvidersInstructionText%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.ProvidersTitle%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.SendText%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.SendToText%2A>. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone> class also contains a number of common properties found in other Web Parts zones: <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.CancelVerb%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.CloseVerb%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.Display%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.EmptyZoneText%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.HeaderText%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.InstructionText%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.PartChromeType%2A>. Finally, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.WebPartToConnect%2A> property is unique to the class, referencing the control that initiates the connection (this is the control on which the user clicks the connect verb in its verbs menu, which is also the control referenced in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control's <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.SelectedWebPart%2A> property).  \n  \n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone> class also has a number of methods, all of which are inherited and overridden from base classes, and most of them come from the base Web Parts zone classes.

Provides a user interface (UI) that enables users to form connections between <xref href=\"System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart\"></xref> and other server controls that reside in <xref href=\"System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase\"></xref> zones.\n  remarks: \"Using the Web Parts control set, you can enable two server controls to form a connection and share data, with one control acting as the provider, and the other acting as the consumer of the data. The two controls can be <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls or any other type of server control, provided that they are designed to handle connections, and that they are residing in a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> zone. To learn more about Web Parts connections, see the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnection> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionPoint> class overviews, as well as [Web Parts Connections Overview](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/d98cfd0f-ebd6-4871-89d5-abbd2cdef67b).  \\n  \\n Provided that the requisite controls and conditions exist to form a Web Parts connection, it is still necessary to actually connect the controls. There are three ways to form a connection between server controls: declaring a connection in a Web page, creating a connection in code, or adding a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone> control to the page so that users can connect the controls on demand. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone> control generates a UI that enables users to connect or disconnect any server controls on a page that meet the conditions necessary to form a connection. It is an optional control that is not necessary to form connections, but is useful in the case where you want to give users control over which server controls are connected or disconnected.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone> control is one of the Web Parts tool zone controls that inherit from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ToolZone> base class. As a tool zone, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone> control is designed to be visible only when its Web page is in a certain display mode. In this case, the display mode is named connect mode (a page is in this mode when the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control on the page has its <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DisplayMode%2A> property value set to <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.ConnectDisplayMode>). After users switch a page into connect mode, they must click a connect verb on the verbs menu of one of the server controls, and then the connection UI becomes visible.  \\n  \\n As a Web Parts zone control, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone> control is a type of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> zone (which inherits from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.CompositeControl> class) designed to contain other controls. In general, a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone> zone has most of the same elements as other Web Parts tool zones: a header, a body or contents area, and a footer. For a complete discussion of what a Web Parts zone is, and the different parts of a zone, see the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> class overview.  \\n  \\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\n>  Unlike most other Web Parts zones, it is important to note that a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone> zone does not contain a unique type of server control associated with it. For a list of zones and the associated controls they contain, see the chart in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> class overview. But the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone> zone does not contain <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnection> controls. Instead, it serves a very limited purpose of providing a UI for users to connect or disconnect server controls that exist in some <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> zone on the page. The only controls contained in a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone> control are the standard ASP.NET server controls that it generates as part of its UI for forming connections.  \\n  \\n When the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone> control is rendered, it generates a UI based on the server controls on the page that are capable of forming connections. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone> control determines which server controls in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> zone on the page are providers, which are consumers, which connection points are available, and whether the server controls are currently connected or disconnected, and then it generates the UI accordingly.  \\n  \\n For example, suppose there is one <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control capable of being a provider, one <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control capable of being a consumer, they are declared in a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> on the page, and they are currently disconnected. When a user switches the page to connect mode and clicks the connect verb on one of the controls, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone> control generates a UI with a link that, when clicked, displays a form in which users can choose options to create a connection. (If the controls were previously connected, the initial view instead presents users with a button to disconnect the controls). In the connection UI for creating new connections, users are shown which control is a provider, and which control is a consumer. A drop-down list control appears below each server control, listing the available <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionPoint> objects for the control. From the respective drop-down lists, users must select one <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ProviderConnectionPoint> object for the provider (to determine what interface and data will be shared with consumers), and one <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConsumerConnectionPoint> object for each consumer (to determine what interface and data the consumer will consume) that will be connected to the provider.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  In the Web Parts control set default implementation, one provider can connect to many consumers, but a consumer can have only one provider.  \\n  \\n To use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone> control, you can declare it within the `<form>` element on a Web page (but not nested within another Web Parts zone element), using the `<asp:connectionszone>` element, or you can add it to the page programmatically. If you declare the element in a page, unlike the other Web Parts zones, you cannot declare any other type of server controls between the tags of the `<asp:connectionszone>` element. You can declare elements within it that relate to its own properties and style details, but it is a standalone element and is not a template control within which other server controls can be declared.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  To improve accessibility, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone> control is rendered within a `<fieldset>` element. The `<fieldset>` element groups the related set of controls used for establishing connections in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone> control, and it facilitates tabbed navigation among those controls for both visual user agents (such as ordinary Web browsers) and speech-oriented user agents (such as screen-reading software).  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone> control has a number of properties it uses for rendering the connection UI. One set of properties includes several verbs--used only in relation to connections--that carry out actions in the UI: <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.ConfigureVerb%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.ConnectVerb%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.DisconnectVerb%2A>. A large set of properties, used especially for the connections zone UI, consists of text strings displayed at various places (or in certain situations, such as when errors occur) in the UI: <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.ConfigureConnectionTitle%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.ConnectToConsumerInstructionText%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.ConnectToConsumerText%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.ConnectToConsumerTitle%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.ConnectToProviderInstructionText%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.ConnectToProviderText%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.ConnectToProviderTitle%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.ConsumersInstructionText%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.ConsumersTitle%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.ExistingConnectionErrorMessage%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.GetFromText%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.GetText%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.InstructionTitle%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.NewConnectionErrorMessage%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.NoExistingConnectionInstructionText%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.NoExistingConnectionTitle%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.ProvidersInstructionText%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.ProvidersTitle%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.SendText%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.SendToText%2A>. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone> class also contains a number of common properties found in other Web Parts zones: <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.CancelVerb%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.CloseVerb%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.Display%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.EmptyZoneText%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.HeaderText%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.InstructionText%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.PartChromeType%2A>. Finally, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone.WebPartToConnect%2A> property is unique to the class, referencing the control that initiates the connection (this is the control on which the user clicks the connect verb in its verbs menu, which is also the control referenced in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control's <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.SelectedWebPart%2A> property).  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone> class also has a number of methods, all of which are inherited and overridden from base classes, and most of them come from the base Web Parts zone classes. For details, see the individual methods.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example demonstrates how to use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone> control on a Web Parts page. The example has four parts:  \\n  \\n-   A user control that enables you to switch display modes on the Web page.  \\n  \\n-   A source file that contains the code for a ZIP Code interface, and two <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls acting as the provider and the consumer for a connection.  \\n  \\n-   A Web page that hosts all the controls, demonstrates how to declare an `<asp:connectionszone>` element, and sets a number of properties on the connections zone declaratively and programmatically.  \\n  \\n-   An explanation of how the example works in a browser.  \\n  \\n The first part of this code example is the user control that enables users to switch display modes on a Web page. For details about display modes and a description of the source code in this control, see [Walkthrough: Changing Display Modes on a Web Parts Page](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/24e42f74-82dc-4c13-8574-130398985fc0).  \\n  \\n <!-- TODO: review snippet reference [!code-csharp[WebParts_ConnectionZone_Overview#6](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_ConnectionZone_Overview/CS/displaymodemenucs.ascx#6)]  -->\\n <!-- TODO: review snippet reference [!code-vb[WebParts_ConnectionZone_Overview#6](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_ConnectionZone_Overview/VB/DisplayModeMenuVB.ascx#6)]  -->  \\n  \\n The second part of the example is the source file with the interface and custom controls. Notice that the `ZipCodeWebPart` control implements the `IZipCode` interface, adding a `ConnectionProvider` attribute so that the control can act as a provider for a connection. The `WeatherWebPart` control has a method marked with a `ConnectionConsumer` attribute, where it consumes the `IZipCode` interface, so it can act as a consumer in a connection.  \\n  \\n For the code example to run, you must compile this source code. You can compile it explicitly and put the resulting assembly in your Web site's Bin folder or the global assembly cache. Alternatively, you can put the source code in your site's App_Code folder, where it will be dynamically compiled at run time. This example uses dynamic compilation. For a walkthrough that demonstrates how to compile, see [Walkthrough: Developing and Using a Custom Web Server Control](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/6d90782a-a1a4-45a6-b2d4-cf6362b83b08).  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[WebParts_ConnectionZone_Overview#2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_ConnectionZone_Overview/CS/ZipCodeComponent.cs#2)]\\n [!code-vb[WebParts_ConnectionZone_Overview#2](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_ConnectionZone_Overview/VB/ZipCodeComponent.vb#2)]  \\n  \\n The third part of the example code is the Web page. Near the top are `Register` directives for the user control and the custom controls used in the connection. An <`asp:connectionszone>` element is declared in the page as an example of using the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone> control declaratively. Within the element, a number of properties are set declaratively. Other properties on the connections zone are set programmatically in the `<script>` section of the page.  \\n  \\n <!-- TODO: review snippet reference [!code-csharp[WebParts_ConnectionZone_Overview#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_ConnectionZone_Overview/CS/connectionZoneCS.aspx#1)]  -->\\n <!-- TODO: review snippet reference [!code-vb[WebParts_ConnectionZone_Overview#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_ConnectionZone_Overview/VB/connectionZoneVB.aspx#1)]  -->  \\n  \\n Load the Web page in a browser. Use the **Display Mode** drop-down list control to switch the page to connect mode. On the verbs menu of the **ZIP Code Provider** control (the verbs menu is indicated by the downward arrow in the control's title bar), click the connect verb. A <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone> control appears. Note that in the connection UI, an **End Connection** button appears; the connection has already been declared in the markup of the page, so the controls are already connected. Click **End Connection**, and then use the **Display Mode** control again to return the page to browse mode. Next, return the page to connect mode again, click the connect verb on one of the controls, and note that the connection UI now displays a hyperlink that enables you to form a connection between the controls. Click the link, and use the connection UI to select connection points and establish the connection.\"\n  syntax:\n    content: 'public class ConnectionsZone : System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ToolZone'\n  inheritance:\n  -
