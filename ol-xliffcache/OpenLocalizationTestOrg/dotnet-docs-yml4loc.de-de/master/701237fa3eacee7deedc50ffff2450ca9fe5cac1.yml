  summary: Space is redistributed based on the value of the <xref href="System.Windows.FrameworkElement.HorizontalAlignment"></xref> and <xref href="System.Windows.FrameworkElement.VerticalAlignment"></xref> properties.
  remarks: "If the value of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter.ResizeDirection%2A> property specifies that space is redistributed between rows, the redistribution follows these guidelines:  \n  \n-   When the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.VerticalAlignment%2A> property is set to <xref:System.Windows.VerticalAlignment.Top>, space is redistributed between the row that is specified for the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter> and the row that is above that row.  \n  \n-   When the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.VerticalAlignment%2A> property is set to <xref:System.Windows.VerticalAlignment.Bottom>, space is redistributed between the row that is specified for the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter> and the row that is below that row.  \n  \n-   When the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.VerticalAlignment%2A> property is set to <xref:System.Windows.VerticalAlignment.Center>, space is redistributed between the row that is above and the row that is below the row that is specified for the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter>.  \n  \n-   When the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.VerticalAlignment%2A> property is set to <xref:System.Windows.VerticalAlignment.Stretch>, space is redistributed between the row that is above and the row that is below the row that is specified for the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter>.  \n  \n If the value of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter.ResizeDirection%2A> property specifies that space is redistributed between columns, the redistribution follows these guidelines:  \n  \n-   When the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.HorizontalAlignment%2A> property is set to <xref:System.Windows.HorizontalAlignment.Left>, space is redistributed between the column that is specified for the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter> and the column that is to the left.  \n  \n-   When the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.HorizontalAlignment%2A> property is set to <xref:System.Windows.HorizontalAlignment.Right>, space is redistributed between the column that is specified for the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter> and the column that is to the right.  \n  \n-   When the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.HorizontalAlignment%2A> property is set to <xref:System.Windows.HorizontalAlignment.Center>, space is redistributed between the columns that are to the left and right of the column that is specified for the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter>.  \n  \n-   When the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.HorizontalAlignment%2A> property is set to <xref:System.Windows.VerticalAlignment.Stretch>, space is redistributed between the columns that are to the left and right of the column that is specified for the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter>."
