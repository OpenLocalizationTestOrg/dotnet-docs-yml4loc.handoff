  summary: Specifies the formula used to calculate the <xref href="System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter.NextValue"></xref> method for a <xref href="System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter"></xref> instance.
  remarks: "Some counter types represent raw data, while others represent calculated values that are based on one or more counter samples. The following categories classify the types of counters available.  \n  \n-   Average: measure a value over time and display the average of the last two measurements. Associated with each average counter is a base counter that tracks the number of samples involved.  \n  \n-   Difference: subtract the last measurement from the previous one and display the difference, if it is positive; if negative, they display a zero.  \n  \n-   Instantaneous: display the most recent measurement.  \n  \n-   Percentage: display calculated values as a percentage.  \n  \n-   Rate: sample an increasing count of events over time and divide the change in count values by the change in time to display a rate of activity.  \n  \n When sampling performance counter data, using a counter type that represents an average can make raw data values meaningful for your use. For example, the raw data counter `NumberOfItems64` can expose data that is fairly random from sample to sample. The formula for an average calculation of the values that the counter returns would be (X 0 +X 1 +â€¦+X n)/n, where each X i is a raw counter sample.  \n  \n Rate counters are similar to average counters, but more useful for situations in which the rate increases as a resource is used. A formula that quickly calculates the average is ((X n -X 0)/(T n -T 0)) / frequency, where each X i is a counter sample and each T i is the time that the corresponding sample was taken. The result is the average usage per second.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Unless otherwise indicated, the time base is seconds.  \n  \n When instrumenting applications (creating and writing custom performance counters), you might be working with performance counter types that rely on an accompanying base counter that is used in the calculations. The base counter must be immediately after its associated counter in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.CounterCreationDataCollection> collection your application uses. The following table lists the base counter types with their corresponding performance counter types.  \n  \n|Base counter type|Performance counter types|  \n|-----------------------|-------------------------------|  \n|`AverageBase`|`AverageTimer32`<br /><br /> `AverageCount64`|  \n|`CounterMultiBase`|`CounterMultiTimer`<br /><br /> `CounterMultiTimerInverse`<br /><br /> `CounterMultiTimer100Ns`<br /><br /> `CounterMultiTimer100NsInverse`|  \n|`RawBase`|`RawFraction`|  \n|`SampleBase`|`SampleFraction`|"

  summary: An average counter that measures the time it takes, on average, to complete a process or operation. Counters of this type display a ratio of the total elapsed time of the sample interval to the number of processes or operations completed during that time. This counter type measures time in ticks of the system clock.
  remarks: "Formula: ((N 1 -N 0)/F)/(B 1 -B 0), where N 1 and N 0 are performance counter readings, B 1 and B 0 are their corresponding `AverageBase` values, and F is the number of ticks per second. The value of F is factored into the equation so that the result can be displayed in seconds. Thus, the numerator represents the numbers of ticks counted during the last sample interval, F represents the frequency of the ticks, and the denominator represents the number of operations completed during the last sample interval.  \n  \n Counters of this type include PhysicalDisk\\ Avg.

  summary: A percentage counter that shows the active time of one or more components as a percentage of the total time of the sample interval. Counters of this type measure time in 100 nanosecond (ns) units.

  summary: A base counter that stores the number of sampling interrupts taken and is used as a denominator in the sampling fraction. The sampling fraction is the number of samples that were 1 (or `true`) for a sample interrupt. Check that this value is greater than zero before using it as the denominator in a calculation of `SampleFraction`.

  summary: An average counter that shows the average number of operations completed in one second. When a counter of this type samples the data, each sampling interrupt returns one or zero. The counter data is the number of ones that were sampled. It measures time in units of ticks of the system performance timer.
  remarks: 'Formula: (N 1 â€“ N 0) / ((D 1 â€“ D 0) / F), where the numerator (N) represents the number of operations completed, the denominator (D) represents elapsed time in units of ticks of the system performance timer, and F represents the number of ticks that elapse in one second. F is factored into the equation so that the result can be displayed in seconds.'
