Alternative user classes such as `inetOrgPerson` are not supported.  \n  \n When using an Active Directory server and the user name is mapped to the `userPrincipalName` attribute, the <xref:System.Web.Security.ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider> class will automatically generate a random 20-character user name for the `sAMAccountName` parameter on your behalf.  \n  \n Parameters default to the following maximum lengths.  \n  \n|Parameter|Maximum length|  \n|---------------|--------------------|  \n|`username`|64 characters if using the `userPrincipalName` attribute.

If the <xref:System.Web.Security.ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider> instance is configured to require unique e-mail addresses, it will also make sure the e-mail address is unique.  \n  \n In an Active Directory user-name uniqueness is enforced by performing a GC search when the user name is mapped to `userPrincipalName`. If `sAMAccountName` is used, then the directory will automatically enforce uniqueness of the `sAMAccountName` across the Active Directory domain.  \n  \n An ADAM server will automatically enforce user name uniqueness of the `userPrincipalName` across all application partitions.  \n  \n Uniqueness of the e-mail address is enforced by performing a subtree search for a duplicate e-mail address starting at the root of the container in which users are created. This is either the default user container (if connected to an Active Directory and no container was specified in the connection string) or the container specified in the connection string.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Web.Security.ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider> class creates the user directly in the user container specified in the connection string.

For more information, see the ADAM Configuration section below.  \\n  \\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\n>  The <xref:System.Web.Security.ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider> instance works only in the full-trust policy default configuration of ASP.NET. In order to use the <xref:System.Web.Security.ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider> instance at any partial-trust level, either you must make changes to the appropriate trust policy file for your application or you must create a \\\"sandbox\\\" assembly that is deployed in the GAC.  \\n>   \\n>  The <xref:System.Web.Security.ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider> class requires unrestricted <xref:System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryServicesPermission> permission to run. This permission is not added to any of the partial-trust policy files supplied with ASP.NET. Although adding the <xref:System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryServicesPermission> permission to a partial-trust policy file will enable use of the <xref:System.Web.Security.ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider> class, doing so makes the <xref:System.DirectoryServices> namespace classes available to any code running in your ASP.NET pages. This option is not recommended for any Web servers that need to run in a secure, locked-down mode.  \\n>   \\n>  As an alternative, you can create a \\\"sandbox\\\" assembly that calls the <xref:System.Web.Security.ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider> class. This assembly can contain either a wrapper class that forwards method calls to the <xref:System.Web.Security.ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider> class or a class that derives from the <xref:System.Web.Security.ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider> class. In either case, the wrapper class must assert unrestricted <xref:System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryServicesPermission> permission. Deploy the sandbox assembly in the GAC and mark the assembly with the <xref:System.Security.AllowPartiallyTrustedCallersAttribute> (APTCA) attribute. This will enable your partially trusted ASP.NET code to call your wrapper class, and since the wrapper class internally asserts the unrestricted <xref:System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryServicesPermission> permission, your wrapper class will be able to successfully call the provider  \\n  \\n You must create a [connectionStrings Element (ASP.NET Settings Schema)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/b6ffbb2e-a4d1-410e-8f7e-9755e92c65de) entry in the Web.config file that identifies the Active Directory server, Active Directory domain, or ADAM application partition to use. The provider will only operate at domain scope, or in a subscope within a domain. The following table lists allowed connection strings and the scope used.  \\n  \\n|Connection string|Scope|  \\n|-----------------------|-----------|  \\n|LDAP://\\\\<domain or server>:[port]<br /><br /> Port number is optional for ADAM and not needed for Active Directory.|The provider runs against the specified domain or server. With AD, user creation and deletion is done in the default users container. All other operations, including any search methods, will be rooted at the default naming context for the domain.<br /><br /> If the connection string specifies an Active Directory domain rather than a specific server and the <xref:System.Web.Security.ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider.EnablePasswordReset%2A> property is `true`, the <xref:System.Web.Security.ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider> instance will always connect to the server with the PDC role for the domain to ensure that password changes take effect and are available when the <xref:System.Web.Security.ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider.ValidateUser%2A> method is called.<br /><br /> This connection string is not allowed when using ADAM, and will throw a <xref:System.NotSupportedException>.|  \\n|LDAP://\\\\<domain or server>:[port]/\\\\<container dn><br /><br /> Port number is optional for ADAM and not needed for Active Directory.|The provider runs against the specified domain or server. User creation and deletion is only done in the specified container. All other operations, including any search methods, perform subtree searches rooted at the container.<br /><br /> For ADAM servers, the container specifies the root of an application partition, or a container within an application partition.<br /><br /> We recommend that the connection string define a specific container to improve performance.|  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Web.Security.ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider> instance maps directory attributes to <xref:System.Web.Security.ActiveDirectoryMembershipUser> properties. Default attributes are used if no attribute mapping is done in the Web.config file. For more information on attribute mappings, see the individual properties in the <xref:System.Web.Security.ActiveDirectoryMembershipUser> class documentation.  \\n  \\n The following table lists the <xref:System.Web.Security.ActiveDirectoryMembershipUser> properties and their default attribute mappings.  \\n  \\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\n>  The <xref:System.Web.Security.ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider> class does not explicitly check that provider attributes are not mapped to core attributes of the user object in the directory.

To support the question and answer, you must set the following configuration attributes using the [add Element for providers for membership (ASP.NET Settings Schema)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/8423ec7f-a06d-4606-977e-a46400b2fc18) in the application configuration file.  \\n  \\n|Configuration attribute|Attribute type|  \\n|-----------------------------|--------------------|  \\n|`attributeMapPasswordQuestion`|Must be a single-valued attribute of type Unicode String.|  \\n|`attributeMapPasswordAnswer`|Must be a single-valued attribute of type Unicode String.|  \\n|`attributeMapFailedPasswordAnswerCount`|Must be a single-valued attribute of type Integer.|  \\n|`attributeMapFailedPasswordAnswerTime`|Must be a single-valued attribute of type Large Integer/Interval.|  \\n|`attributeMapFailedPasswordAnswerLockoutTime`|Must be a single-valued attribute of type Large Integer/Interval.|  \\n  \\n For more information on using password-reset security, see the <xref:System.Web.Security.ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider.RequiresQuestionAndAnswer%2A> property.  \\n  \\n## Active Directory connections  \\n When the <xref:System.Web.Security.ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider> class is used to connect to an Active Directory or an Active Directory Application Mode (ADAM) server, the `connectionProtection` attribute that is set using the [add Element for providers for membership (ASP.NET Settings Schema)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/8423ec7f-a06d-4606-977e-a46400b2fc18) in the application configuration file may restrict the types of operations the <xref:System.Web.Security.ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider> class can perform over the connection. The `connectionProtection` attribute also determines the methods the <xref:System.Web.Security.ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider> instance will use to create the connection to the Active Directory or ADAM server.  \\n  \\n The following table shows the effect of the `connectionProtection` attribute when connecting to an Active Directory.  \\n  \\n|`connectionProtection` setting|Effect|  \\n|------------------------------------|------------|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.Security.ActiveDirectoryConnectionProtection.None>|The <xref:System.Web.Security.ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider> class will connect to an Active Directory, with these restrictions.<br /><br /> -   Any method that sets a password will fail.

You can import the `User` class with an LDIF import of the `MS-User.ldf` file available in the ADAM install directory.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Web.Security.ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider> class will work with an ADAM server configured to use the default network ports.
