Represents a 5-tuple, or quintuple.\n  remarks: \"A tuple is a data structure that has a specific number and sequence of values. The <xref:System.Tuple%605> class represents a 5-tuple, or quintuple, which is a tuple that has five components.  \\n  \\n You can instantiate a <xref:System.Tuple%605> object by calling either the <xref:System.Tuple%605.%23ctor%2A> constructor or the static <xref:System.Tuple.Create%60%605%28%60%600%2C%60%601%2C%60%602%2C%60%603%2C%60%604%29?displayProperty=fullName> method. You can retrieve the value of the tuple's components by using the read-only <xref:System.Tuple%605.Item1%2A>, <xref:System.Tuple%605.Item2%2A>, <xref:System.Tuple%605.Item3%2A>, <xref:System.Tuple%605.Item4%2A>, and <xref:System.Tuple%605.Item5%2A> instance properties.  \\n  \\n Tuples are commonly used in four different ways:  \\n  \\n-   To represent a single set of data. For example, a tuple can represent a database record, and its components can represent individual fields of the record.  \\n  \\n-   To provide easy access to, and manipulation of, a data set. The following example defines an array of <xref:System.Tuple%605> objects that contain the names of running backs in American football, the number of games in which they played, and the number of carries, total yards gained, and touchdowns scored during those games. The array is passed to the `ComputeStatistics` method, which calculates each running back's number of carries per game, average yards per game, average yards per carry, and average number of touchdowns per attempt.  \\n  \\n     [!code-csharp[System.Tuple\\\\`5.Class#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.tuple`5.class/cs/example1.cs#1)]\\n     [!code-vb[System.Tuple\\\\`5.Class#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.tuple`5.class/vb/example1.vb#1)]  \\n  \\n-   To return multiple values from a method without the use of `out` parameters (in C#) or `ByRef` parameters (in Visual Basic). For example, the previous example returns its computed statistics, along with the name of the player, in an array of <xref:System.Tuple%605> objects.  \\n  \\n-   To pass multiple values to a method through a single parameter. For example, the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Start%28System.Object%29?displayProperty=fullName> method has a single parameter that lets you supply one value to the method that the thread executes at startup. If you supply a <xref:System.Tuple%605> object as the method argument, you can supply the thread’s startup routine with five items of data.\"\n  syntax:\n    content: 'public class Tuple<T1,T2,T3,T4,T5> : IComparable, System.Collections.IStructuralComparable, System.Collections.IStructuralEquatable'\n    typeParameters:\n    - id: T1\n      description: The type of the tuple's first component.\n    - id: T2\n      description: The type of the tuple's second component.\n    - id: T3\n      description: The type of the tuple's third component.\n    - id: T4\n      description: The type of the tuple's fourth component.\n    - id: T5\n      description: The type of the tuple's fifth component.\n  inheritance:\n  - System.Object\n  implements:\n  - System.Collections.IStructuralComparable\n  - System.Collections.IStructuralEquatable\n  - System.IComparable\n  inheritedMembers:\n  - System.Object.Equals(System.Object,System.Object)\n  - System.Object.GetType\n  - System.Object.MemberwiseClone\n  - System.Object.ReferenceEquals(System.Object,System.Object)\n  extensionMethods:\n  - System.TupleExtensions.Deconstruct``5(System.Tuple{``0,``1,``2,``3,``4},``0@,``1@,``2@,``3@,``4@)\n  - System.TupleExtensions.ToValueTuple``5(System.Tuple{``0,``1,``2,``3,``4})\n  version:\n  - netcore-1.0\n  - netcore-1.1\n  - netcore-2.0\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  - netstandard-1.0\n  - netstandard-1.1\n  - netstandard-1.2\n  - netstandard-1.3\n  - netstandard-1.4\n  - netstandard-1.5\n  - netstandard-1.6\n  - netstandard-2.0\n  - xamarinandroid-7.1\n  - xamarinios-10.8\n  - xamarinmac-3.0\n  monikers:\n  - netcore-1.0\n  - netcore-1.1\n  - netcore-2.0\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  - netstandard-1.0\n  - netstandard-1.1\n  - netstandard-1.2\n  - netstandard-1.3\n  - netstandard-1.4\n  - netstandard-1.5\n  - netstandard-1.6\n  - netstandard-2.0\n  - xamarinandroid-7.1\n  - xamarinios-10.8\n  - xamarinmac-3.0\n  content_git_url: https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/xml/System/Tuple`5.xml\n  ms.technology:\n  - dotnet-standard\n  author: rpetrusha\n  ms.author: ronpet\n  manager: wpickett\n- uid: System.Tuple`5.#ctor(`0,`1,`2,`3,`4)\n  commentId: M:System.Tuple`5.#ctor(`0,`1,`2,`3,`4)\n  id: '#ctor(`0,`1,`2,`3,`4)'\n  parent: System.Tuple`5\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: Tuple<T1,T2,T3,T4,T5>(T1, T2, T3, T4, T5)\n  nameWithType: Tuple<T1,T2,T3,T4,T5>.Tuple<T1,T2,T3,T4,T5>(T1, T2, T3, T4, T5)\n  fullName: Tuple<T1,T2,T3,T4,T5>.Tuple<T1,T2,T3,T4,T5>(T1, T2, T3, T4, T5)\n  type: Constructor\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Runtime\n  - mscorlib\n  - netstandard\n  namespace: System\n  summary: Initializes a new instance of the <xref href=\"System.Tuple`5\"></xref> class.\n  remarks: \"You can also use the static <xref:System.Tuple.Create%60%605%28%60%600%2C%60%601%2C%60%602%2C%60%603%2C%60%604%29?displayProperty=fullName> method to instantiate a 5-tuple object without having to explicitly specify the types of its components.
