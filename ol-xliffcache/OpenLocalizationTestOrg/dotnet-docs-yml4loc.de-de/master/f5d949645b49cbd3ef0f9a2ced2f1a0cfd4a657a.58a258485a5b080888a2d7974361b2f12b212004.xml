There must be one--and only one--<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control instance on every page that uses Web Parts controls. As with most aspects of Web Parts applications, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control works only with authenticated users. Further, its functionality works almost entirely with server controls that reside within Web Parts zones that inherit from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> class. Server controls that reside on a page outside of these zones can have very little Web Parts functionality or interaction with the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control.  \n  \n As the hub for Web Parts functionality on a page, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control carries out the kinds of tasks described in the following table.  \n  \n|Task category|What the control does|  \n|-------------------|---------------------------|  \n|Tracking Web Parts controls|Keeps track of the many different kinds of controls on a page that provide Web Parts features, including <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, connections, zones, and others.|  \n|Adding and removing Web Parts controls|Provides the methods for adding, deleting, and closing <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls on a page.|  \n|Administering connections|Creates connections between controls, and monitors the connections as well as the processes of adding and removing them.|  \n|Personalizing controls and pages|Enables users to move controls to different locations on a page, and launches the views in which users can edit the appearance, properties, and behavior of controls. Maintains user-specific personalization settings on each page.|  \n|Toggling between different page views|Switches a page among different specialized views of the page, so that users can carry out certain tasks such as changing page layout or editing controls.|  \n|Raising Web Parts life-cycle events|Defines, raises, and enables developers to handle life-cycle events of Web Parts controls, such as when controls are being added, moved, connected, or deleted.|  \n|Enabling import and export of controls|Exports XML streams that contain the state of the properties of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, and allows users to import the files for convenience in personalizing complex controls in other pages or sites.|  \n  \n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> class has a large set of properties. Consistent with the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> role of tracking other controls, it has a number of properties that reference collections of either Web Parts controls, or other special Web Parts objects. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.AvailableTransformers%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.Connections%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.Controls%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DisplayModes%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DynamicConnections%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.SupportedDisplayModes%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebParts%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.Zones%2A> properties are all collections used by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control for its tracking and other management tasks.  \n  \n Another group of properties contains customizable warnings that apply in certain scenarios that occur in a Web Parts application. These include the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.CloseProviderWarning%2A>, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DeleteWarning%2A>, and the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.ExportSensitiveDataWarning%2A> properties.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> class overrides some of its base inherited properties, which are used by many Web server controls. These include the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.EnableTheming%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.SkinID%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.Visible%2A> properties.  \n  \n Finally, there is a group of properties useful for accessing the current state of the application. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DisplayMode%2A> property indicates the current display mode that a page is in. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.EnableClientScript%2A> property indicates whether a control is allowed to render client-side script, which is relevant in situations where users might have browsers with different capabilities or have scripting turned off. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.Internals%2A> property is useful for referencing a utility class that contains the calls to a number of important Web Parts methods that are used for extensibility cases. By hiding the calls to these methods in a separate class (the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManagerInternals> class), the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> class's own API is simplified. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.Personalization%2A> property provides access to the personalization objects that store users' personalization settings and persist that data to permanent storage. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.SelectedWebPart%2A> property indicates which <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control on a page is currently selected by the user or the application. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.System%23Web%23UI%23WebControls%23WebParts%23IPersonalizable%23IsDirty%2A> property indicates whether custom personalization data on a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control has changed.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control contains five built-in display modes, or views of a Web page. Developers can extend this feature, creating custom display modes by extending types such as the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> class or the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ToolZone> class. Users can switch a page into the various display modes, provided that the proper kind of controls that correspond to a given display mode are present on a page.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  It is possible to extend this feature so that users can switch into a custom display mode without having a corresponding zone on the page. However, the default behavior is that display modes correspond to zones.  \n  \n The standard display modes are represented by public fields in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> class. The following table summarizes the fields and the display modes they refer to. The current display mode of a page, as noted above, is always referenced in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DisplayMode%2A> property, and the set of display modes that is possible on a particular page, given the kind of zones that are present on the page, is contained in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.SupportedDisplayModes%2A> property.  \n  \n|Field|Display mode details|  \n|-----------|--------------------------|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.BrowseDisplayMode>|The normal user view of a Web page; the default and most common display mode.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DesignDisplayMode>|The view in which users can rearrange or delete controls to change the page layout.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.EditDisplayMode>|The view in which an editing user interface (UI) becomes visible; users can edit the appearance, properties, and behavior of the controls that are visible in the normal browse mode.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.CatalogDisplayMode>|The view in which a catalog UI becomes visible; users can add controls to a page from catalogs of available controls.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.ConnectDisplayMode>|The view in which a connection UI becomes visible; users can connect, manage, or disconnect connections between controls.|  \n  \n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control also contains a number of events that are critical in the life cycle of Web Parts pages and controls. These events provide precise programmatic control over the behavior of Web Parts controls. Most methods pertain directly to <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls (or other server or user controls that are placed in <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> zones so that they can behave as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls). However, a few events pertain to the state of the page or connections on the page. The following table lists the available events and summarizes their purposes.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  In all cases in the following table, the word \"control\" refers to a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control or any server control that resides in a zone and is wrapped with a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart> object at run time.  \n  \n|Event|Description|  \n|-----------|-----------------|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.AuthorizeWebPart>|Occurs just before a control is added to a page to verify that it is authorized.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.ConnectionsActivated>|Occurs after all the connections on a page have been activated.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.ConnectionsActivating>|Occurs just before the process of activating all the connections on a page.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DisplayModeChanged>|Occurs after the current display mode of a page has changed.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DisplayModeChanging>|Occurs just before the process of changing a page's display mode.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.SelectedWebPartChanged>|Occurs after the selection of a control has been canceled.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.SelectedWebPartChanging>|Occurs just before the process of canceling the selection of a control.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartAdded>|Occurs after a control has been added to a zone.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartAdding>|Occurs just before the process of adding a control to a zone.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartClosed>|Occurs after a control has been closed (removed from a page).|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartClosing>|Occurs just before the process of closing a control.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartDeleted>|Occurs after an instance of a dynamic control (one that was created programmatically or added from a catalog) has been permanently deleted.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartDeleting>|Occurs just before the process of deleting a dynamic control.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartMoved>|Occurs after a control has moved within its zone or to another zone.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartMoving>|Occurs just before the process of moving a control.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsConnected>|Occurs after two controls selected for participation in a connection have established the connection.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsConnecting>|Occurs just before the process of connecting two controls.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsDisconnected>|Occurs after two connected controls have been disconnected.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsDisconnecting>|Occurs just before the process of disconnecting two controls.|  \n  \n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control has numerous methods for managing Web Parts pages. A large set of the methods, not listed here, are methods whose names take the form of On*EventName*. These methods typically raise their associated event, and provide the event with a handler of type <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartEventHandler>. Most of these methods can be overridden by developers who inherit from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> class. Also, page developers can provide custom handlers for the events associated with these methods. For example, in the case of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartAdded> event, a page developer could add an `OnWebPartAdded` attribute to the `<asp:webpartmanager>` element in the markup of a Web page, and then assign a custom method name to the attribute to provide custom handling for the event. The attribute corresponds to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.OnWebPartAdded%2A> method, and this basic pattern of event handling works for most Web Parts events and their associated methods.  \n  \n In addition, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control has methods particular to the task of managing <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls (and server or user controls used as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls). These methods include <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.AddWebPart%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.AuthorizeWebPart>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.CloseWebPart%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.CopyWebPart%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.CreateWebPart%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DeleteWebPart%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DisconnectWebPart%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.BeginWebPartEditing%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.EndWebPartEditing%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.ExportWebPart%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.GetGenericWebPart%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.ImportWebPart%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.IsAuthorized%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.MoveWebPart%2A>.  \n  \n Another set of methods is specialized for connections. This includes methods such as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.ActivateConnections%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.BeginWebPartConnecting%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.CanConnectWebParts%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.ConnectWebParts%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.CreateAvailableTransformers%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DisconnectWebPart%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DisconnectWebParts%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.EndWebPartConnecting%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.GetConsumerConnectionPoints%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.GetProviderConnectionPoints%2A>.  \n  \n Finally, some <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> methods focus on personalization functionality. These include <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.CreatePersonalization%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.LoadControlState%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.SaveCustomPersonalizationState%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.SetPersonalizationDirty%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.System%23Web%23UI%23WebControls%23WebParts%23IPersonalizable%23Load%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.System%23Web%23UI%23WebControls%23WebParts%23IPersonalizable%23Save%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.SaveControlState%2A>.  \n  \n For more information on other <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> methods that are accessible through the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.Internals%2A> property, see the documentation for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManagerInternals> class.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,815],"content":"The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control acts as the hub or control center of a Web Parts application.

<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.IsAuthorized%2A> method, when a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control is being checked for authorization to be added to a page. When the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.OnAuthorizeWebPart%2A> method is called, it raises the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.AuthorizeWebPart> event, and if there is a handler method for the event, it invokes the handler.  \n  \n The process of authorizing <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls is an important Web Parts feature. Every <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> or server control that is added to a zone by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control goes through an authorization process to determine whether the control can be added. By default, the Web Parts control set does not provide any filtering criteria to prevent controls from being added to a zone. But the control set does provide the mechanisms necessary for developers to create their own filtering criteria. By using these mechanisms, you can create custom filtering scenarios. For example, you could create a filter so that, if a user is in an administrator role, certain controls would be added to a zone when the page is rendered, and if the user is in a user role, those controls would not be added.  \n  \n The mechanisms for filtering controls during the authorization process are the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AuthorizationFilter%2A> property on <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.IsAuthorized%2A> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.OnAuthorizeWebPart%2A> methods, and the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.AuthorizeWebPart> event on the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control.  \n  \n To create a filtering scenario, there are essentially two tasks. First, you assign strings to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AuthorizationFilter%2A> property of each <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control you want to filter. These string values can be arbitrary, but they should contain the criteria you want to filter on. For example, if you wanted a given control to be added to a zone only if an administrator user is viewing the page, then you might assign a string value of `admin` to the property. Then you could use the ASP.NET roles feature, and add all users of your site to various roles such as administrator, manager, and user. When a page is loading, your filtering code would check what role a user is in, compare it to the authorization filter value on a control being checked, and if (for example) the user is in an administrator role and you had set the control's <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AuthorizationFilter%2A> value to `admin`, the control could be added.  \n  \n The second step in creating a filtering scenario is to write code to check the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AuthorizationFilter%2A> property values on <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, and determine whether each control is authorized before it is added to its zone. There are two options for where to place this filtering code. The first option is the preferred option for page developers. You can create a method to handle the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.AuthorizeWebPart> event directly in the Web page server script code, or in a code separation file. Associate your method with the event by adding the `OnAuthorizeWebPart` attribute to the tag for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control in the page, as shown in the following sample markup code.  \n  \n```  \n<asp:webpartmanager id=\"manager1\" runat=\"server\"   \n   OnAuthorizeWebPart=\"manager1_AuthorizeWebPart\" />  \n```  \n  \n All your custom method has to do is check each <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control for the filtering criteria and then, based on the results, assign a Boolean value to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartAuthorizationEventArgs.IsAuthorized%2A> property of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartAuthorizationEventArgs> object to indicate whether the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control can be added. The code in the Example section demonstrates how to do this.  \n  \n The second option for where to place your filtering code is to inherit from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> class, and override a method to check the filter criteria. The two methods you can override to do this are the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.IsAuthorized%28System.Type%2CSystem.String%2CSystem.String%2CSystem.Boolean%29?displayProperty=fullName> method or the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.OnAuthorizeWebPart%2A> method. Although either method would work, in most cases it is preferable to override the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.IsAuthorized%2A> method, because it provides you with greater programmatic control over the whole authorization process, whereas the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.OnAuthorizeWebPart%2A> method does only one specific task, which is to raise the event and check for a handler. For a code example of a custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> class that overrides the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.IsAuthorized%2A> method, see the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.IsAuthorized%28System.Type%2CSystem.String%2CSystem.String%2CSystem.Boolean%29?displayProperty=fullName> overload of the method.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,583],"content":"The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.OnAuthorizeWebPart%2A> method is called by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.IsAuthorized%2A> method, when a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control is being checked for authorization to be added to a page.

System.Web\n  namespace: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts\n  summary: Serves as the central class of the Web Parts control set, managing all the Web Parts controls, functionality, and events that occur on a Web page.\n  remarks: \"The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control acts as the hub or control center of a Web Parts application. There must be one--and only one--<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control instance on every page that uses Web Parts controls. As with most aspects of Web Parts applications, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control works only with authenticated users. Further, its functionality works almost entirely with server controls that reside within Web Parts zones that inherit from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> class. Server controls that reside on a page outside of these zones can have very little Web Parts functionality or interaction with the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control.  \\n  \\n As the hub for Web Parts functionality on a page, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control carries out the kinds of tasks described in the following table.  \\n  \\n|Task category|What the control does|  \\n|-------------------|---------------------------|  \\n|Tracking Web Parts controls|Keeps track of the many different kinds of controls on a page that provide Web Parts features, including <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, connections, zones, and others.|  \\n|Adding and removing Web Parts controls|Provides the methods for adding, deleting, and closing <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls on a page.|  \\n|Administering connections|Creates connections between controls, and monitors the connections as well as the processes of adding and removing them.|  \\n|Personalizing controls and pages|Enables users to move controls to different locations on a page, and launches the views in which users can edit the appearance, properties, and behavior of controls. Maintains user-specific personalization settings on each page.|  \\n|Toggling between different page views|Switches a page among different specialized views of the page, so that users can carry out certain tasks such as changing page layout or editing controls.|  \\n|Raising Web Parts life-cycle events|Defines, raises, and enables developers to handle life-cycle events of Web Parts controls, such as when controls are being added, moved, connected, or deleted.|  \\n|Enabling import and export of controls|Exports XML streams that contain the state of the properties of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, and allows users to import the files for convenience in personalizing complex controls in other pages or sites.|  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> class has a large set of properties. Consistent with the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> role of tracking other controls, it has a number of properties that reference collections of either Web Parts controls, or other special Web Parts objects. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.AvailableTransformers%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.Connections%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.Controls%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DisplayModes%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DynamicConnections%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.SupportedDisplayModes%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebParts%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.Zones%2A> properties are all collections used by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control for its tracking and other management tasks.  \\n  \\n Another group of properties contains customizable warnings that apply in certain scenarios that occur in a Web Parts application. These include the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.CloseProviderWarning%2A>, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DeleteWarning%2A>, and the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.ExportSensitiveDataWarning%2A> properties.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> class overrides some of its base inherited properties, which are used by many Web server controls. These include the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.EnableTheming%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.SkinID%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.Visible%2A> properties.  \\n  \\n Finally, there is a group of properties useful for accessing the current state of the application. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DisplayMode%2A> property indicates the current display mode that a page is in. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.EnableClientScript%2A> property indicates whether a control is allowed to render client-side script, which is relevant in situations where users might have browsers with different capabilities or have scripting turned off. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.Internals%2A> property is useful for referencing a utility class that contains the calls to a number of important Web Parts methods that are used for extensibility cases. By hiding the calls to these methods in a separate class (the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManagerInternals> class), the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> class's own API is simplified. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.Personalization%2A> property provides access to the personalization objects that store users' personalization settings and persist that data to permanent storage. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.SelectedWebPart%2A> property indicates which <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control on a page is currently selected by the user or the application. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.System%23Web%23UI%23WebControls%23WebParts%23IPersonalizable%23IsDirty%2A> property indicates whether custom personalization data on a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control has changed.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control contains five built-in display modes, or views of a Web page. Developers can extend this feature, creating custom display modes by extending types such as the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> class or the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ToolZone> class. Users can switch a page into the various display modes, provided that the proper kind of controls that correspond to a given display mode are present on a page.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  It is possible to extend this feature so that users can switch into a custom display mode without having a corresponding zone on the page. However, the default behavior is that display modes correspond to zones.  \\n  \\n The standard display modes are represented by public fields in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> class. The following table summarizes the fields and the display modes they refer to. The current display mode of a page, as noted above, is always referenced in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DisplayMode%2A> property, and the set of display modes that is possible on a particular page, given the kind of zones that are present on the page, is contained in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.SupportedDisplayModes%2A> property.  \\n  \\n|Field|Display mode details|  \\n|-----------|--------------------------|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.BrowseDisplayMode>|The normal user view of a Web page; the default and most common display mode.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DesignDisplayMode>|The view in which users can rearrange or delete controls to change the page layout.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.EditDisplayMode>|The view in which an editing user interface (UI) becomes visible; users can edit the appearance, properties, and behavior of the controls that are visible in the normal browse mode.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.CatalogDisplayMode>|The view in which a catalog UI becomes visible; users can add controls to a page from catalogs of available controls.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.ConnectDisplayMode>|The view in which a connection UI becomes visible; users can connect, manage, or disconnect connections between controls.|  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control also contains a number of events that are critical in the life cycle of Web Parts pages and controls. These events provide precise programmatic control over the behavior of Web Parts controls. Most methods pertain directly to <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls (or other server or user controls that are placed in <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> zones so that they can behave as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls). However, a few events pertain to the state of the page or connections on the page. The following table lists the available events and summarizes their purposes.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  In all cases in the following table, the word \\\"control\\\" refers to a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control or any server control that resides in a zone and is wrapped with a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart> object at run time.  \\n  \\n|Event|Description|  \\n|-----------|-----------------|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.AuthorizeWebPart>|Occurs just before a control is added to a page to verify that it is authorized.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.ConnectionsActivated>|Occurs after all the connections on a page have been activated.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.ConnectionsActivating>|Occurs just before the process of activating all the connections on a page.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DisplayModeChanged>|Occurs after the current display mode of a page has changed.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DisplayModeChanging>|Occurs just before the process of changing a page's display mode.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.SelectedWebPartChanged>|Occurs after the selection of a control has been canceled.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.SelectedWebPartChanging>|Occurs just before the process of canceling the selection of a control.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartAdded>|Occurs after a control has been added to a zone.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartAdding>|Occurs just before the process of adding a control to a zone.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartClosed>|Occurs after a control has been closed (removed from a page).|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartClosing>|Occurs just before the process of closing a control.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartDeleted>|Occurs after an instance of a dynamic control (one that was created programmatically or added from a catalog) has been permanently deleted.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartDeleting>|Occurs just before the process of deleting a dynamic control.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartMoved>|Occurs after a control has moved within its zone or to another zone.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartMoving>|Occurs just before the process of moving a control.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsConnected>|Occurs after two controls selected for participation in a connection have established the connection.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsConnecting>|Occurs just before the process of connecting two controls.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsDisconnected>|Occurs after two connected controls have been disconnected.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsDisconnecting>|Occurs just before the process of disconnecting two controls.|  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control has numerous methods for managing Web Parts pages. A large set of the methods, not listed here, are methods whose names take the form of On*EventName*. These methods typically raise their associated event, and provide the event with a handler of type <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartEventHandler>. Most of these methods can be overridden by developers who inherit from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> class. Also, page developers can provide custom handlers for the events associated with these methods. For example, in the case of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartAdded> event, a page developer could add an `OnWebPartAdded` attribute to the `<asp:webpartmanager>` element in the markup of a Web page, and then assign a custom method name to the attribute to provide custom handling for the event. The attribute corresponds to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.OnWebPartAdded%2A> method, and this basic pattern of event handling works for most Web Parts events and their associated methods.  \\n  \\n In addition, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control has methods particular to the task of managing <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls (and server or user controls used as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls). These methods include <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.AddWebPart%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.AuthorizeWebPart>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.CloseWebPart%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.CopyWebPart%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.CreateWebPart%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DeleteWebPart%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DisconnectWebPart%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.BeginWebPartEditing%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.EndWebPartEditing%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.ExportWebPart%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.GetGenericWebPart%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.ImportWebPart%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.IsAuthorized%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.MoveWebPart%2A>.  \\n  \\n Another set of methods is specialized for connections. This includes methods such as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.ActivateConnections%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.BeginWebPartConnecting%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.CanConnectWebParts%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.ConnectWebParts%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.CreateAvailableTransformers%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DisconnectWebPart%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DisconnectWebParts%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.EndWebPartConnecting%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.GetConsumerConnectionPoints%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.GetProviderConnectionPoints%2A>.  \\n  \\n Finally, some <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> methods focus on personalization functionality. These include <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.CreatePersonalization%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.LoadControlState%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.SaveCustomPersonalizationState%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.SetPersonalizationDirty%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.System%23Web%23UI%23WebControls%23WebParts%23IPersonalizable%23Load%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.System%23Web%23UI%23WebControls%23WebParts%23IPersonalizable%23Save%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.SaveControlState%2A>.  \\n  \\n For more information on other <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> methods that are accessible through the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.Internals%2A> property, see the documentation for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManagerInternals> class.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example demonstrates both declarative and programmatic use of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control.  \\n  \\n The code example has four parts:  \\n  \\n-   A user control that enables you to change display modes on a Web Parts page.  \\n  \\n-   A Web page that contains two custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls that can be connected, and an `<asp:webpartmanager>` element.  \\n  \\n-   A source code file that contains two custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, and a custom interface.  \\n  \\n-   An explanation of how the example works in a browser.  \\n  \\n The user control has a drop-down list control that shows the possible display modes on a page, given the Web Parts controls that are present on the page. In the Web page for this code example, this user control is declared just below the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> element in the page's markup, and there is a `Register` directive near the top of the Web page to register the control. For details about display modes and a description of the source code in this control, see [Walkthrough: Changing Display Modes on a Web Parts Page](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/24e42f74-82dc-4c13-8574-130398985fc0).  \\n  \\n <!-- TODO: review snippet reference [!code-csharp[WebParts_WebPartManager_SimpleConnection#6](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_WebPartManager_SimpleConnection/CS/displaymodemenucs.ascx#6)]  -->\\n <!-- TODO: review snippet reference [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartManager_SimpleConnection#6](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_WebPartManager_SimpleConnection/VB/DisplayModeMenuVB.ascx#6)]  -->  \\n  \\n The declarative markup for the Web page contains `Register` directives for both the user control and the custom controls. There is an `<asp:webpartmanager>` element, an `<asp:webpartzone>` element to contain the custom controls, and an `<asp:connectionszone>` element. The page also contains some inline code that handles connection-related events for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control; you can see the effect of this code as you connect and disconnect controls.  \\n  \\n <!-- TODO: review snippet reference [!code-csharp[WebParts_WebPartManager_SimpleConnection#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_WebPartManager_SimpleConnection/CS/webpartmanagerConnectionCS.aspx#1)]  -->\\n <!-- TODO: review snippet reference [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartManager_SimpleConnection#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_WebPartManager_SimpleConnection/VB/webpartmanagerConnectionVB.aspx#1)]  -->  \\n  \\n The third part of the example is the source code for the controls. Note that there is an interface named `IZipCode`, and this interface is implemented in the `ZipCodeWebPart` class. This class has a special callback method named `ProvideIZipCode` that serves as a provider. The other type, named `WeatherWebPart`, is also implemented with a special method named `GetIZipCode`, which enables the control to act as a consumer of the other control.  \\n  \\n For the code example to run, you must compile this source code. You can compile it explicitly and put the resulting assembly in your Web site's Bin folder or the global assembly cache. Alternatively, you can put the source code in your site's App_Code folder, where it will be dynamically compiled at run time. This code example assumes that you have compiled the source into an assembly, and the `Register` directive in the Web page references the assembly name. For a walkthrough that demonstrates how to compile, see [Walkthrough: Developing and Using a Custom Web Server Control](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/6d90782a-a1a4-45a6-b2d4-cf6362b83b08).  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[WebParts_WebPartManager_SimpleConnection#2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_WebPartManager_SimpleConnection/CS/ZipCodeComponent.cs#2)]\\n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartManager_SimpleConnection#2](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_WebPartManager_SimpleConnection/VB/ZipCodeComponent.vb#2)]  \\n  \\n After you have loaded the Web page in a browser, click the **Display Mode** drop-down list control and select **Connect** to switch the page to connect mode. Connect mode uses the `<asp:connectionszone>` element to enable you to create connections between controls. In connect mode, click the downward arrow in the title bar of the **ZIP Code** control to activate its verbs menu, and then click **Connect**. After the connection UI appears, click the **Create a connection to a Consumer** link. A cell appears that has a drop-down list control. Select **Weather Control** in the drop-down list, and then click **Connect** to complete the connection of the two controls. Click **Close**, and then use the **Display Mode** drop-down list to return the page to normal browse mode. You can enter a ZIP Code, and the consumer control will be updated with the value you enter. Because the `ZipCode` property was marked with the `Personalizable` attribute in the source code, this property value will persist across browser sessions, thus saving the value entered by a user. A more sophisticated consumer control could take the ZIP code information, look up weather information based on the code, and display it to a user.\"\n  syntax:\n    content: >-\n      [System.ComponentModel.Bindable(false)]\n\n      public class WebPartManager : System.Web.UI.Control, System.Web.UI.INamingContainer, System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IPersonalizable\n  inheritance:\n  -

There are a number of common scenarios where a control can be added to a page.

This assumes the default approach is to allow users to view controls with a page in user personalization scope. Notice, however, that in the example one of the controls has its <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AuthorizationFilter%2A> property value set to `admin`.

You can obtain the source code for the user control from the Example section of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> class overview.

There is an `<asp:webpartmanager>` element, an `<asp:webpartzone>` element to contain the custom controls, and an `<asp:connectionszone>` element. Notice that in the `Page_Load` method, the code checks whether the connection can be made and, if so, defines a provider, a consumer, and their respective connection points, and then adds a new connection to the set of static connections referenced by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.StaticConnections%2A> property.  \\n  \\n <!-- TODO: review snippet reference [!code-csharp[WebParts_WebPartManager_StaticConnections#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_WebPartManager_StaticConnections/CS/wpmgrStaticConnectionCS.aspx#1)]  -->\\n <!-- TODO: review snippet reference [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartManager_StaticConnections#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_WebPartManager_StaticConnections/VB/wpmgrStaticConnectionVB.aspx#1)]  -->  \\n  \\n The third part of the example is the source code for the controls.

A closed <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control still appears in the collection referenced by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebParts%2A> property.  \\n  \\n Closing a control is different from deleting it. Closed controls are still available to be restored to a page, but a deleted control instance is permanently removed and can never be restored. Regardless of whether a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> or server control is static (declared in the markup of a page) or dynamic (added to the page programmatically or by a user from a Web Parts catalog), it can be closed and reopened on a page.  \\n  \\n Typically, users can close a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control by clicking its verbs menu and selecting the close verb. A control can also be closed by directly calling the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.CloseWebPart%2A> method and passing it a reference to `webPart`.  \\n  \\n On a page where <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls have been closed, if a developer declares an `<asp:catalogzone>` element, and within it adds an `<asp:pagecatalogpart>` element, it provides a simple user interface (UI) for users to restore closed controls to the page at run time. Users can switch the page into catalog display mode, and the closed controls will appear within the page catalog. Users can select closed controls and add them back to the page at whatever position they desire, and then the selected controls are restored to the page and rendered as normal.  \\n  \\n When the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.CloseWebPart%2A> method is called, it raises several events: <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartClosing>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.SelectedWebPartChanging> (if there are multiple controls), and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsDisconnecting> (if there are connected controls). Normally developers can cancel these events, but in certain cases it is not possible to cancel them. For details, see the documentation for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartClosing>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.SelectedWebPartChanging>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsDisconnecting> events.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example demonstrates how to use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.CloseWebPart%2A> method.  \\n  \\n The code example has four parts:  \\n  \\n-   A user control that enables you to change page display modes.  \\n  \\n-   A custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control.  \\n  \\n-   A Web page.  \\n  \\n-   An explanation of how the example works in a browser.  \\n  \\n The first part of the code example is the user control for changing display modes.

For the code example to run, you must compile this source code. You can compile it explicitly and put the resulting assembly in your Web site's Bin folder or the global assembly cache. Alternatively, you can put the source code in your site's App_Code folder, where it will be dynamically compiled at run time. This example uses the dynamic compilation approach; thus there is no `Assembly` attribute in the `Register` directive for this control at the top of the Web page. For a walkthrough that demonstrates how to compile, see [Walkthrough: Developing and Using a Custom Web Server Control](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/6d90782a-a1a4-45a6-b2d4-cf6362b83b08).  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[WebParts_WebPartManager_CloseWebPart#3](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_WebPartManager_CloseWebPart/CS/textdisplaywebpart.cs#3)]\\n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartManager_CloseWebPart#3](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_WebPartManager_CloseWebPart/VB/textdisplaywebpart.vb#3)]  \\n  \\n The third part of the code example is the Web page.

The connect display mode displays a special UI for managing connections, which includes the ability to connect or disconnect controls, and to edit the details of existing connections.  \\n  \\n If you want to provide users with the ability to manage connections with the UI provided by the Web Parts control set, you must declare an `<asp:connectionszone>` element in the markup of a page. Unlike the elements for the other types of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> zones, you do not need to add any other tags within this element; you simply declare the element by itself.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example demonstrates the usage of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.ConnectDisplayMode> mode.  \\n  \\n The code example has three parts:  \\n  \\n-   A source file that contains an interface and custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls that can form a connection.  \\n  \\n-   A Web page that provides a connection UI and demonstrates working with the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.ConnectDisplayMode> mode.  \\n  \\n-   An explanation of how to run the example.  \\n  \\n The first part of the code example is a source file that contains an interface and two custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls that are designed so they can be connected.

Within the server `<script>` tags on the page are several methods that populate a drop-down list with the display modes available on the page. A user can select these from the drop-down list to change the page's display mode. One of the available display modes is connect display mode, because an `<asp:connectionszone>` element is declared in the page's markup. Notice that this element does not contain any other child elements; it exists only to enable the connection management UI for users.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.ConnectDisplayMode> mode appears in this example in two places. First, in the `Page_Init` method, the connect display mode is added to the drop-down list of display modes, as the code loops through the collection referenced in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.SupportedDisplayModes%2A> property. Second, the `Page_PreRender` method checks the current display mode on the page, and if the current mode is <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.ConnectDisplayMode>, a message is displayed in a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Label> control.  \\n  \\n <!-- TODO: review snippet reference [!code-csharp[WebParts_WebPartManager_ConnectDisplayMode#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_WebPartManager_ConnectDisplayMode/CS/ConnectDisplayModecs.aspx#1)]  -->\\n <!-- TODO: review snippet reference [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartManager_ConnectDisplayMode#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_WebPartManager_ConnectDisplayMode/VB/ConnectDisplayModeVB.aspx#1)]  -->  \\n  \\n After you load the page in a browser, click the drop-down list and select **Connect** to switch the page into connect display mode.

To create a custom display mode, you must inherit from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartDisplayMode> class, and to add your display mode as a supported mode on a page, you must inherit from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> class and override the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.CreateDisplayModes%2A> method.  \\n  \\n When you add display modes by using the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartDisplayModeCollection.Add%2A> method, you should add them in the order that you want them to appear in any user interface (UI) controls (such as a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.ListBox> control) that provide to users the possible display modes on a page.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example demonstrates how to use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.CreateDisplayModes%2A> method.  \\n  \\n The code example has five parts:  \\n  \\n-   A user control that enables you to change display modes on a Web Parts page.  \\n  \\n-   A Web page that hosts the other controls.  \\n  \\n-   A user control that resides in a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> zone on the Web page, and enables you to enter and display text in a label.  \\n  \\n-   A source code file that contains two controls. One is a custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control, and the other is a custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartDisplayMode> object to add to the page's default display modes.  \\n  \\n-   A source code file that contains two custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, and a custom interface.  \\n  \\n-   An explanation of how the example works in a browser.  \\n  \\n The first part of the code example is the user control for changing display modes. You can obtain the source code for the user control from the Example section of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> class overview. For more information about display modes and how the user control works, see [Walkthrough: Changing Display Modes on a Web Parts Page](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/24e42f74-82dc-4c13-8574-130398985fc0).  \\n  \\n The second part of the example is the Web page. It contains two <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> controls, both user controls, and the custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control. Notice the `Register` directives at the top of the page to reference the user controls and namespace for the compiled controls.  \\n  \\n <!-- TODO: review snippet reference [!code-csharp[Webparts_WebPartManager_CreateDisplayModes#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_WebPartManager_CreateDisplayModes/CS/createDisplayModeCS.aspx#1)]  -->\\n <!-- TODO: review snippet reference [!code-vb[Webparts_WebPartManager_CreateDisplayModes#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_WebPartManager_CreateDisplayModes/VB/createDisplayModeVB.aspx#1)]  -->  \\n  \\n The third part of the example is the user control for entering and displaying text. It uses a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.MultiView> control to create multiple views of the UI. One view appears with the `Button1` button, the other without. Notice that in the overridden `OnPreRender` method, the code checks to see whether the page is currently in the custom display mode and, if so, displays the first view of the user control, which includes the button. If the page is not in the custom display mode, for example if the page is in browse or design mode, the button is hidden.  \\n  \\n <!-- TODO: review snippet reference [!code-csharp[Webparts_WebPartManager_CreateDisplayModes#2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_WebPartManager_CreateDisplayModes/CS/TextDisplaycs.ascx#2)]  -->\\n <!-- TODO: review snippet reference [!code-vb[Webparts_WebPartManager_CreateDisplayModes#2](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_WebPartManager_CreateDisplayModes/VB/TextDisplayvb.ascx#2)]  -->  \\n  \\n The fourth part of the example is the source file for the two custom classes. Notice that the custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> class overrides the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.CreateDisplayModes%2A> method, and that it first calls the base method to add all the default display modes, and then adds the custom display mode. The custom display mode class, `InLineEditDisplayMode`, simply inherits from <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartDisplayMode>, sets the name of the display mode in the constructor, and overrides a number of the base properties to establish the characteristics of the custom display.  \\n  \\n For the code example to run, you must compile this source code. You can compile it explicitly and put the resulting assembly in your Web site's Bin folder or the global assembly cache. Alternatively, you can put the source code in your site's App_Code folder, where it will be dynamically compiled at run time. For a walkthrough that demonstrates how to compile, see [Walkthrough: Developing and Using a Custom Web Server Control](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/6d90782a-a1a4-45a6-b2d4-cf6362b83b08).  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[Webparts_WebPartManager_CreateDisplayModes#3](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_WebPartManager_CreateDisplayModes/CS/CustomDisplayMode.cs#3)]\\n [!code-vb[Webparts_WebPartManager_CreateDisplayModes#3](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_WebPartManager_CreateDisplayModes/VB/CustomDisplayMode.vb#3)]  \\n  \\n To run the code example, load the page in a browser. Notice that the page is currently in browse mode, and no button is visible. Using the **Display Mode** drop-down list control, change the page to **Inline Edit Display** mode, and notice that now the `Button1` button is visible in the lower user control. Add some text, and click the button to update the control. Notice that the page display is returned to browse mode, the text you entered is now displayed, and the button is once again hidden because the page is no longer in the custom display mode.\"\n  syntax:\n    content: protected virtual System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartDisplayModeCollection CreateDisplayModes ();\n    parameters: []\n    return:\n      type: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartDisplayModeCollection\n      description: A <xref href=\"System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartDisplayModeCollection\"></xref> that contains all the display modes that are supported.\n  overload: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.CreateDisplayModes*\n  exceptions: []\n  version:\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  monikers:\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  content_git_url: https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/xml/System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts/WebPartManager.xml\n  ms.technology:\n  - dotnet-webforms\n  author: tdykstra\n  ms.author: tdykstra\n  manager: wpickett\n- uid: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.CreateDynamicConnectionID\n  commentId: M:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.CreateDynamicConnectionID\n  id: CreateDynamicConnectionID\n  parent: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: CreateDynamicConnectionID()\n  nameWithType: WebPartManager.CreateDynamicConnectionID()\n  fullName: WebPartManager.CreateDynamicConnectionID()\n  type: Method\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Web\n  namespace: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts\n  summary: Gets a unique value to serve as an ID for a dynamic connection.\n  remarks: The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.CreateDynamicConnectionID%2A> method generates a GUID value and converts it to a string to serve as the unique ID for a connection.

Using two custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, the Web page enables you to create a connection between the controls by clicking a button, while another button enables you to disconnect the controls.  \\n  \\n The code example has four parts:  \\n  \\n-   A user control for changing display modes.  \\n  \\n-   A source file containing custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls.  \\n  \\n-   A Web page to host the controls.  \\n  \\n-   An explanation of how the example works in a browser.  \\n  \\n The first part of the code example is the user control for changing display modes. You can obtain the source code for the user control from the Example section of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> class overview. For more information about display modes and how the user control works, see [Walkthrough: Changing Display Modes on a Web Parts Page](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/24e42f74-82dc-4c13-8574-130398985fc0).  \\n  \\n The second part is a file containing the source code for the two custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls that will be connected. For the code example to run, you must compile this source code. You can compile it explicitly and put the resulting assembly in your Web site's Bin folder or the global assembly cache. Alternatively, you can put the source code in your site's App_Code folder, where it will be dynamically compiled at run time. This example uses dynamic compilation, so the `Register` directive that references these components in the Web page is declared accordingly at the top of the Web page. For a walkthrough that demonstrates compiling options, see [Walkthrough: Developing and Using a Custom Web Server Control](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/6d90782a-a1a4-45a6-b2d4-cf6362b83b08).  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[WebParts_WebPartManager_DisconnectWebParts#2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_WebPartManager_DisconnectWebParts/CS/ZipCodeComponent.cs#2)]\\n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartManager_DisconnectWebParts#2](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_WebPartManager_DisconnectWebParts/VB/ZipCodeComponent.vb#2)]  \\n  \\n The third part of the code example is the Web page. Notice that near the top, it contains `Register` directives to register the user control and the dynamically compiled assembly with the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls. The page has two primary methods. The `Button1_Click` method creates a connection between the controls, and the `Button2_Click` method disconnects the controls.  \\n  \\n <!-- TODO: review snippet reference [!code-csharp[WebParts_WebPartManager_DisconnectWebParts#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_WebPartManager_DisconnectWebParts/CS/wpmgrDisconnectWebPartsCS.aspx#1)]  -->\\n <!-- TODO: review snippet reference [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartManager_DisconnectWebParts#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_WebPartManager_DisconnectWebParts/VB/wpmgrDisconnectWebPartsVB.aspx#1)]  -->  \\n  \\n After you load the page, you can click the **Connect** button to connect the controls.

Developers can set the parameter to `true` to indicate that the data is sensitive.  \\n  \\n To enable `webPart` to be exported, a developer sets its <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.ExportMode%2A> property value to either <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartExportMode.All> (which includes all personalizable and sensitive properties), or to <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartExportMode.NonSensitiveData>, which exports everything except for sensitive properties.  \\n  \\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\n>  Allowing users to export data from controls, and to import data into other controls, entails some security risks. Developers should use the approach discussed above to protect sensitive data, and if they want to avoid the risk of exposing data altogether, they should not enable export on `webPart` at all.

This authorization value can be checked at run time, and the control can be added to the page if the filter matches criteria set by the developer.  \\n  \\n <!-- TODO: review snippet reference [!code-csharp[WebParts_WebPartManager_IsAuthorized#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_WebPartManager_IsAuthorized/CS/IsAuthorizedCS.aspx#1)]  -->\\n <!-- TODO: review snippet reference [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartManager_IsAuthorized#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_WebPartManager_IsAuthorized/VB/IsAuthorizedVB.aspx#1)]  -->  \\n  \\n The second step is to override the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.IsAuthorized%28System.Type%2CSystem.String%2CSystem.String%2CSystem.Boolean%29> method, and create custom handling for authorization filters. Note that the code first checks whether the property has a value, so that any control that does not assign the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AuthorizationFilter%2A> property will be added automatically. If a control has a filter, the code returns `true` only if the filter value is equal to `admin`. This demonstrates a simple mechanism you can use for displaying certain controls to certain users, depending on their role. While a full example using roles is beyond the scope of this topic, you could use the same logic as the overridden method in this code example, except that you could check whether the current user is in a role that matches the authorization filter value, and then add the control only for that user. This would enable you to create pages where some users would see all the controls, and other users would see only selected controls. This is how the logic that checks the filter might look if you used roles:  \\n  \\n```vb  \\nIf Roles.IsUserInRole(Page.User.Identity.Name, authorizationFilter) Then  \\n  return True  \\nElse  \\n  return False  \\nEnd If  \\n```  \\n  \\n```csharp  \\nif(Roles.IsUserInRole(Page.User.Identity.Name, authorizationFilter))  \\n    return true;  \\nelse  \\n    return false;  \\n```  \\n  \\n For the code example to run, you must compile this source code. You can compile it explicitly and put the resulting assembly in your Web site's Bin folder or the global assembly cache. Alternatively, you can put the source code in your site's App_Code folder, where it will be dynamically compiled at run time. This code example uses the dynamic compile method. For a walkthrough that demonstrates how to compile, see [Walkthrough: Developing and Using a Custom Web Server Control](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/6d90782a-a1a4-45a6-b2d4-cf6362b83b08).  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[WebParts_WebPartManager_IsAuthorized#2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_WebPartManager_IsAuthorized/CS/MyManagerAuthorize.cs#2)]\\n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartManager_IsAuthorized#2](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_WebPartManager_IsAuthorized/VB/MyManagerAuthorize.vb#2)]  \\n  \\n After you load the page in a browser, note that the first control is displayed, because it matches the criteria in the overridden method. The second control is not added to the page, because its filter value is excluded. The third control is added, because it does not have its <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AuthorizationFilter%2A> property set. If you change the property value on the second control to match that of the first control, and then run the page again, the second control is added as well.\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public virtual bool IsAuthorized (Type type, string path, string authorizationFilter, bool isShared);\n    parameters:\n    - id: type\n      type: System.Type\n      description: The <xref href=\"System.Type\"></xref> of the control being checked for authorization.\n    - id: path\n      type: System.String\n      description: The relative application path to the source file for the control being authorized, if the control is a user control.\n    - id: authorizationFilter\n      type: System.String\n      description: An arbitrary string value assigned to the <xref href=\"System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AuthorizationFilter\"></xref> property of a <xref href=\"System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart\"></xref> control, used to authorize whether a control can be added to a page.\n    - id: isShared\n      type: System.Boolean\n      description: Indicates whether the control being checked for authorization is a shared control, meaning that it is visible to many or all users of the application, and its <xref href=\"System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.IsShared\"></xref> property value is set to `true`.\n    return:\n      type: System.Boolean\n      description: A Boolean value that indicates whether a control is authorized to be added to a page.\n  overload: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.IsAuthorized*\n  exceptions:\n  - type: System.ArgumentNullException\n    commentId: T:System.ArgumentNullException\n    description: <code>type</code> is `null`.\n  - type: System.ArgumentException\n    commentId: T:System.ArgumentException\n    description: \"<code>type</code> is a user control, and <code>path</code> is either `null` or an empty string (\\\"\\\").  \\n  \\n \\\\- or -  \\n  \\n <code>type</code> is not a user control, and <code>path</code> has a value assigned to it.\"\n  version:\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  monikers:\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  content_git_url: https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/xml/System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts/WebPartManager.xml\n  ms.technology:\n  - dotnet-webforms\n  author: tdykstra\n  ms.author: tdykstra\n  manager: wpickett\n- uid: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.IsCustomPersonalizationStateDirty\n  commentId: P:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.IsCustomPersonalizationStateDirty\n  id: IsCustomPersonalizationStateDirty\n  parent: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: IsCustomPersonalizationStateDirty\n  nameWithType: WebPartManager.IsCustomPersonalizationStateDirty\n  fullName: WebPartManager.IsCustomPersonalizationStateDirty\n  type: Property\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Web\n  namespace: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts\n  summary: Gets a value that indicates whether personalization changes have been made that affect page-level personalization details controlled by the <xref href=\"System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager\"></xref> control.\n  remarks: \"The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control uses the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.IsCustomPersonalizationStateDirty%2A> property internally to track whether any of the page-level personalization data that it manages has changed.

When the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.OnAuthorizeWebPart%2A> method is called, it raises the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.AuthorizeWebPart> event, and if there is a handler method for the event, it invokes the handler.  \\n  \\n The process of authorizing <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls is an important Web Parts feature. Every <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> or server control that is added to a zone by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control goes through an authorization process to determine whether the control can be added. By default, the Web Parts control set does not provide any filtering criteria to prevent controls from being added to a zone. But the control set does provide the mechanisms necessary for developers to create their own filtering criteria. By using these mechanisms, you can create custom filtering scenarios. For example, you could create a filter so that, if a user is in an administrator role, certain controls would be added to a zone when the page is rendered, and if the user is in a user role, those controls would not be added.  \\n  \\n The mechanisms for filtering controls during the authorization process are the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AuthorizationFilter%2A> property on <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.IsAuthorized%2A> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.OnAuthorizeWebPart%2A> methods, and the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.AuthorizeWebPart> event on the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control.  \\n  \\n To create a filtering scenario, there are essentially two tasks. First, you assign strings to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AuthorizationFilter%2A> property of each <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control you want to filter. These string values can be arbitrary, but they should contain the criteria you want to filter on. For example, if you wanted a given control to be added to a zone only if an administrator user is viewing the page, then you might assign a string value of `admin` to the property. Then you could use the ASP.NET roles feature, and add all users of your site to various roles such as administrator, manager, and user. When a page is loading, your filtering code would check what role a user is in, compare it to the authorization filter value on a control being checked, and if (for example) the user is in an administrator role and you had set the control's <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AuthorizationFilter%2A> value to `admin`, the control could be added.  \\n  \\n The second step in creating a filtering scenario is to write code to check the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AuthorizationFilter%2A> property values on <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, and determine whether each control is authorized before it is added to its zone. There are two options for where to place this filtering code. The first option is the preferred option for page developers. You can create a method to handle the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.AuthorizeWebPart> event directly in the Web page server script code, or in a code separation file. Associate your method with the event by adding the `OnAuthorizeWebPart` attribute to the tag for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control in the page, as shown in the following sample markup code.  \\n  \\n```  \\n<asp:webpartmanager id=\\\"manager1\\\" runat=\\\"server\\\"   \\n   OnAuthorizeWebPart=\\\"manager1_AuthorizeWebPart\\\" />  \\n```  \\n  \\n All your custom method has to do is check each <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control for the filtering criteria and then, based on the results, assign a Boolean value to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartAuthorizationEventArgs.IsAuthorized%2A> property of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartAuthorizationEventArgs> object to indicate whether the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control can be added. The code in the Example section demonstrates how to do this.  \\n  \\n The second option for where to place your filtering code is to inherit from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> class, and override a method to check the filter criteria. The two methods you can override to do this are the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.IsAuthorized%28System.Type%2CSystem.String%2CSystem.String%2CSystem.Boolean%29?displayProperty=fullName> method or the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.OnAuthorizeWebPart%2A> method. Although either method would work, in most cases it is preferable to override the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.IsAuthorized%2A> method, because it provides you with greater programmatic control over the whole authorization process, whereas the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.OnAuthorizeWebPart%2A> method does only one specific task, which is to raise the event and check for a handler. For a code example of a custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> class that overrides the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.IsAuthorized%2A> method, see the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.IsAuthorized%28System.Type%2CSystem.String%2CSystem.String%2CSystem.Boolean%29?displayProperty=fullName> overload of the method.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example demonstrates how to set a custom event handler for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.AuthorizeWebPart> event, so that the handler can provide custom filtering code for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.OnAuthorizeWebPart%2A> method. This example would be a typical way for a page developer to provide a filtering scenario and authorization of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls to be added to a page.  \\n  \\n In the Web page, notice that the `<asp:webpartmanager>` element has the `OnAuthorizeWebPart` attribute with the name of the event handler assigned to it. The method checks whether the controls on the page have their respective <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AuthorizationFilter%2A> property values set to `admin` and, if so, returns `true`, which means that they will be authorized and added to the page.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  Note that controls that do not have any value assigned to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AuthorizationFilter%2A> property are added as well, because they are assumed not to be part of a filtering scenario. This would be a common approach in a filtering scenario: some controls would be filtered, and others would not be, because they are presumed to be available for all users.  \\n  \\n <!-- TODO: review snippet reference [!code-csharp[WebParts_WebPartManager_AuthorizeWebPart#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_WebPartManager_AuthorizeWebPart/CS/AuthorizeWebPartCS.aspx#1)]  -->\\n <!-- TODO: review snippet reference [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartManager_AuthorizeWebPart#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_WebPartManager_AuthorizeWebPart/VB/AuthorizeWebPartVB.aspx#1)]  -->  \\n  \\n Because setting up users in roles is beyond the scope of this topic, this code example does not check user roles in the filtering. However, the scenario of filtering controls according to user roles is likely to be one of the most common uses of this filtering feature. If you have roles on your site, and you want to check user roles in this method to filter controls, the method would resemble the following code block (versus the simpler approach in the preceding code example, which does not use roles).  \\n  \\n```vb  \\nProtected Sub WebPartManager1_AuthorizeWebPart(ByVal sender _  \\n  As Object, ByVal e As WebPartAuthorizationEventArgs)  \\n  \\n  If String.IsNullOrEmpty(e.AuthorizationFilter) Then  \\n    If Roles.IsUserInRole(Page.User.Identity.Name, _  \\n      e.AuthorizationFilter) Then  \\n  \\n      e.IsAuthorized = True  \\n    Else  \\n      e.IsAuthorized = False  \\n    End If  \\n  End If  \\n  \\nEnd Sub  \\n```  \\n  \\n```csharp  \\nprotected void mgr1_AuthorizeWebPart(object sender,   \\n  WebPartAuthorizationEventArgs e)  \\n{  \\n  if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(e.AuthorizationFilter))  \\n  {  \\n    if(Roles.IsUserInRole(Page.User.Identity.Name, e.authorizationFilter))  \\n      e.IsAuthorized = true;  \\n    else  \\n      e.IsAuthorized = false;  \\n  }  \\n}  \\n```\"\n  syntax:\n    content: protected virtual void OnAuthorizeWebPart (System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartAuthorizationEventArgs e);\n    parameters:\n    - id: e\n      type: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartAuthorizationEventArgs\n      description: A <xref href=\"System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartAuthorizationEventArgs\"></xref> that contains event data.\n  overload: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.OnAuthorizeWebPart*\n  exceptions: []\n  version:\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  monikers:\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  content_git_url: https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/xml/System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts/WebPartManager.xml\n  ms.technology:\n  - dotnet-webforms\n  author: tdykstra\n  ms.author: tdykstra\n  manager: wpickett\n- uid: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.OnConnectionsActivated(System.EventArgs)\n  commentId: M:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.OnConnectionsActivated(System.EventArgs)\n  id: OnConnectionsActivated(System.EventArgs)\n  parent: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: OnConnectionsActivated(EventArgs)\n  nameWithType: WebPartManager.OnConnectionsActivated(EventArgs)\n  fullName: WebPartManager.OnConnectionsActivated(EventArgs)\n  type: Method\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Web\n  namespace: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts\n  summary: Raises the <xref href=\"System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.ConnectionsActivated\"></xref> event to indicate that a page and its controls are loaded, and connections on the page have been activated to begin sharing data.\n  remarks: \"The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.OnConnectionsActivated%2A> method raises the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.ConnectionsActivated> event after a page has completed the loading process.

Using this property, you can access the various members of the personalization object. For example, you can use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartPersonalization.ToggleScope%2A> method to switch the page's personalization scope from shared to user scope, or vice versa. You can also find out the current personalization scope of the page, whether personalization is even enabled on the page, which provider is being used for the personalization data, and more.  \\n  \\n Note that the data referenced by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.Personalization%2A> property is only the page-level personalization data that is tracked by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control.

The **Toggle Scope** button switches the page to user or shared personalization scope. The **Edit Mode** and **Browse Mode** buttons each switch the page into the appropriate display mode. Notice that in the `<script>` tag section of the file, two of the methods that handle events use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.Personalization%2A> property to access useful members of the underlying object. Specifically, these methods use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartPersonalization.ToggleScope%2A> method and the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartPersonalization.Scope%2A> property on the object accessed through the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.Personalization%2A> property.  \\n  \\n <!-- TODO: review snippet reference [!code-csharp[WebParts_WebPartManager_Personalization#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_WebPartManager_Personalization/CS/wpmgrPersonalizationCS.aspx#1)]  -->\\n <!-- TODO: review snippet reference [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartManager_Personalization#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_WebPartManager_Personalization/VB/wpmgrPersonalizationVB.aspx#1)]  -->  \\n  \\n For the code example to run, you also must enable a user or users to personalize pages in shared scope. Add an entry to the Web.config file, within the `<system.web>` section, that looks like the following markup.  \\n  \\n```  \\n<webParts>  \\n  <personalization>  \\n    <authorization>  \\n      <allow  \\n        users=\\\"[Replace the text and brackets with a user name or   \\n           group.]\\\"  \\n        roles=\\\"admin\\\"   \\n        verbs=\\\"enterSharedScope\\\"  />  \\n    </authorization>  \\n  </personalization>  \\n</webParts>   \\n```  \\n  \\n After you load the page in a browser, click the **Toggle Scope** button, and notice that the page now says the scope is shared. Click **Edit Mode** to change the display mode, click the verbs menu on the visible control, and select **Edit** from the menu. Notice that the user interface (UI) for both editing controls appears. Now click **Browse Mode** to return to normal browsing. If the page says it is in shared scope, click **Toggle Scope** again to ensure the page is in user scope. Next, follow the same steps to edit the control again, but notice that now in the editing UI, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.BehaviorEditorPart> control does not appear.

Notice that in the `Page_Load` method, the code checks to see whether a connection already exists and, if not, defines a provider, a consumer, and their respective connection points, and then adds a new connection to the set of static connections referenced by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.StaticConnections%2A> property.  \\n  \\n <!-- TODO: review snippet reference [!code-csharp[WebParts_WebPartManager_StaticConnections#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_WebPartManager_StaticConnections/CS/wpmgrStaticConnectionCS.aspx#1)]  -->\\n <!-- TODO: review snippet reference [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartManager_StaticConnections#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_WebPartManager_StaticConnections/VB/wpmgrStaticConnectionVB.aspx#1)]  -->  \\n  \\n After you have loaded the Web page in a browser, click the **Display Mode** drop-down list control and select **Connect** to switch the page to connect mode.

The event provides an opportunity to cancel the process of ending a connection before it is complete. If the connection is ended successfully, this event is followed by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsDisconnected> event.  \\n  \\n Page developers can add a custom handler for the event by adding the `OnWebPartsDisconnecting` attribute to the `<asp:webpartmanager>` element, and assigning a custom method name to the attribute.  \\n  \\n Normally, when the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsDisconnecting> event is raised as a direct result of a user's action that ends a connection, the event can be cancelled. However, there are several scenarios in which the event cannot be cancelled. The first scenario is, if a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> control is deleted, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls it contains must all be closed, otherwise they would be orphaned. In this case the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control closes the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, not the user, and it must also be able to terminate the connections of any connected controls without any chance of interruption, so that it can complete the process of cleaning up and closing all the controls. Therefore, by design the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsDisconnecting> method cannot be cancelled in this scenario. For a related event that can be cancelled, see the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartClosing> event.  \\n  \\n The second scenario in which the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsDisconnecting> event cannot be cancelled is when the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.ActivateConnections%2A> method is called (this called during each request to a page, for example), and there is some type of conflict in the existing connections on a page. For example, perhaps a user connects control x to control y, but a shared user connects control x to control z, and yet control x is not allowed to form multiple connections. In this case, the individual user's settings for the connection take precedence, and the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control resolves the conflict by calling the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DisconnectWebPart%2A> method and ending the connection between x and z for the particular user. Because this disconnection is essential to resolving the conflict, by design the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsDisconnecting> event cannot be cancelled in this scenario.  \\n  \\n The third scenario in which the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsDisconnecting> method cannot be cancelled is when a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> or server control that is currently connected is either deleted or closed. Because the control is definitely going to be removed from the page, it is a logical necessity to remove its connection. Therefore, when the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control invokes the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DisconnectWebPart%2A> method, which in turn raises the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsDisconnecting> event, by design there is no possibility of canceling the event.\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public event System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnectionsCancelEventHandler WebPartsDisconnecting;\n    return:\n      type: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnectionsCancelEventHandler\n      description: ''\n  exceptions: []\n  version:\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  monikers:\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  content_git_url: https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/xml/System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts/WebPartManager.xml\n  ms.technology:\n  - dotnet-webforms\n  author: tdykstra\n  ms.author: tdykstra\n  manager: wpickett\n- uid: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.Zones\n  commentId: P:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.Zones\n  id: Zones\n  parent: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: Zones\n  nameWithType: WebPartManager.Zones\n  fullName: WebPartManager.Zones\n  type: Property\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Web\n  namespace: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts\n  summary: Gets a reference to a collection of all the <xref href=\"System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase\"></xref> zones on a Web page.\n  remarks: \"The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.Zones%2A> property is used by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control to track the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> zones on a Web page.

The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.System%23Web%23UI%23WebControls%23WebParts%23IPersonalizable%23IsDirty%2A> property indicates only whether personalization data that is at the page level and is managed by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control has changed.  \\n  \\n The following list describes some common instances of personalization that would cause the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.System%23Web%23UI%23WebControls%23WebParts%23IPersonalizable%23IsDirty%2A> property to return a value of `true`, indicating that the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control has some changed personalization data:  \\n  \\n-   Closing a static <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control (or server or user control) on a page.  \\n  \\n-   Restoring a closed static <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control from a page catalog back to a page.  \\n  \\n-   Moving any control within its zone or to another zone.  \\n  \\n-   Adding a control from a catalog of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> or server controls, or adding a control programmatically.  \\n  \\n-   Creating a connection between two <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, either programmatically or by using the connection user interface (UI).  \\n  \\n-   Deleting a connection between two <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, either programmatically or by using the connection UI.  \\n  \\n To access this property value, you must cast the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control instance to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IPersonalizable> interface; you can then read the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IPersonalizable.IsDirty%2A> property value.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example demonstrates a simple usage of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.System%23Web%23UI%23WebControls%23WebParts%23IPersonalizable%23IsDirty%2A> property, to indicate some common page personalization instances that cause a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control's personalization data to change.  \\n  \\n The code example has four parts:  \\n  \\n-   A user control that allows you to change display modes on a page that contains Web Parts controls.  \\n  \\n-   A source file that contains the code for two custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls that can be connected, and an interface.  \\n  \\n-   A Web page that hosts all the controls.  \\n  \\n-   An explanation of how the code example works.  \\n  \\n The first part of the code example is the user control for changing display modes. You can obtain the source code for the user control from the Example section of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> class overview. For information about display modes and how the user control works, see [Walkthrough: Changing Display Modes on a Web Parts Page](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/24e42f74-82dc-4c13-8574-130398985fc0).  \\n  \\n The second part of the example is the source file with the custom controls and the interface. Notice that the `IZipCode` interface exposes one method, and that this method as implemented in the custom `ZipCodeWebPart` control serves as a callback method to enable `ZipCodeWebPart` to act as a provider in a connection scenario. The other control, `WeatherWebPart`, acts as the consumer control in a connection; it can consume the particular interface provided by `ZipCodeWebPart`. In a real application, `WeatherWebPart` could consume a personalized ZIP Code value from the provider, and then provide graphical weather information to users.  \\n  \\n For the code example to run, you must compile this source code. You can compile it explicitly and put the resulting assembly in your Web site's Bin folder or the global assembly cache. Alternatively, you can put the source code in your site's App_Code folder, where it will be dynamically compiled at run time. This code example uses dynamic compilation; therefore, notice that the `Register` directive for this component at the top of the Web page contains only `TagPrefix` and `Namespace` attributes, without an `Assembly` attribute. For a walkthrough that demonstrates how to compile, see [Walkthrough: Developing and Using a Custom Web Server Control](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/6d90782a-a1a4-45a6-b2d4-cf6362b83b08).  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[WebParts_WebPartManager_IsDirty#2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_WebPartManager_IsDirty/CS/ZipCodeComponent.cs#2)]\\n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPartManager_IsDirty#2](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_WebPartManager_IsDirty/VB/ZipCodeComponent.vb#2)]  \\n  \\n The third part of the code example is the Web page. Notice that it contains two <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> zones, with the first one containing the two custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls. There is also a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZone> zone, which contains a standard <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Calendar> control that users can add to the page. The `<asp:connectionszone>` element provides a connection UI for users to create connections between controls.
