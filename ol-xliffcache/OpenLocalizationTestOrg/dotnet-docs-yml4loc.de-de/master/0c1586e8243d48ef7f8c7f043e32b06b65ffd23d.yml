  remarks: "> [!NOTE]\n>  [!INCLUDE[DeprecatedContent](~/includes/deprecatedcontent-md.md)]  \n  \n A workflow instance can pass through several states during the course of its execution. For example, a workflow instance may become idle, or it may be suspended. Every time the workflow instance changes state, it emits a workflow status event to the runtime tracking infrastructure. <xref:System.Workflow.Runtime.Tracking.TrackingWorkflowEvent> enumerates the possible types of workflow status event."
