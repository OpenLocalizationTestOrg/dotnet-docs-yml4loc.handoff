The left mouse button down event is the most likely event to have class handling in a control. The class handling often marks the underlying <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse> class event as handled. Once the event is marked handled, other instance handlers that are attached to that element are not ordinarily raised. Any other class or instance handlers that are attached to elements in the bubbling direction towards the root in the UI tree are also not ordinarily raised.  \n  \n You can resolve the issue that is outlined in the preceding Important and still receive <xref:System.Windows.UIElement3D.MouseDown> events for left mouse button down events on a derived class that has class handling by using either of these solutions:  \n  \n-   Attach handlers for the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement3D.PreviewMouseDown> event, which is not marked as handled by the controls. Notice that because this is a preview event, the route starts at the root and tunnels down to the control.  \n  \n-   Register a handler on the control procedurally by calling <xref:System.Windows.UIElement3D.AddHandler%2A> and choosing the signature option that enables handlers to listen for events even if they are already marked as handled in the routed event data.  \n  \n <xref:System.Windows.UIElement3D.MouseDown> is introduced in the .NET Framework version 3.5.

Other programming features that rely on keystrokes, for example, input and command bindings, might handle the keystroke before it is exposed as a general keystroke. If these input system features mark the event as handled, then <xref:System.Windows.UIElement3D.OnKeyDown%2A> is not invoked.  \n  \n This method has no default implementation. Because an intermediate class in the inheritance might implement this method, we recommend that you call the base implementation in your implementation.  \n  \n The purpose of this method is similar to the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_clr](~/includes/tlasharptla-clr-md.md)] event pattern On* methods: this method provides the means to handle the matching event from derived classes by establishing a class handler instead of an instance handler. In this case the matching event is a routed event. The implementation pattern of the On* methods is different for routed events because a routed event can be raised by a child element, which is not necessarily the element that will invoke handlers. Therefore, your implementation needs to examine the source properties of the event data. It should not try to reraise the event in most cases.  \n  \n Either by overriding this method or by registering class handlers with <xref:System.Windows.EventManager.RegisterClassHandler%2A>, derived classes of <xref:System.Windows.UIElement3D> can call private class handler methods when the event is received along the event route.

Specify <code>handledEventsToo</code> as `true` to have the provided handler be invoked for routed event that had already been marked as handled by another element along the event route.\n  remarks: \"Processing low-level input events in a practical way is a complex task. Many controls implement behavior where a certain event is marked as handled, and is replaced by another more intuitive event. Generally, a control will only mark a platform input event as handled if there is some design intention for doing so. In certain scenarios, those design intentions might not be what your particular handling of the input event requires. It is for these scenarios that registering handlers with `handledEventsToo` as `true` is appropriate. But you should not do this routinely. Invoking handlers in response to all events even if handled will complicate your own application event processing logic. You may see a decrease in performance if the handler logic is substantial. You should reserve the use of attaching handlers for already-handled events for situations where you have already discovered during the development process that certain controls are handling events that you still want to handle with application logic.  \\n  \\n Another technique for avoiding the class handling behavior of certain event-control combinations is to use that event's preview alternative. For example, if <xref:System.Windows.UIElement3D.MouseLeftButtonDown> is marked handled by class handling, you might be able to add handlers for <xref:System.Windows.UIElement3D.PreviewMouseLeftButtonDown> instead.  \\n  \\n You can add the same handler for the same event multiple times without raising an exception.

Event handlers that are attached to the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement3D.MouseDown> event are attached to the underlying <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.MouseDown?displayProperty=fullName> attached event and receive the same event data instance.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Windows.UIElement3D.MouseDown> event is often raised together with either <xref:System.Windows.UIElement3D.MouseLeftButtonDown> or <xref:System.Windows.UIElement3D.MouseRightButtonDown>, which correspond to a press of one of the two standard mouse buttons. <xref:System.Windows.UIElement3D.MouseLeftButtonDown> and <xref:System.Windows.UIElement3D.MouseRightButtonDown> are also routed events, but they are direct routed events, and the appropriate button-specific event is raised when the <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.MouseDown?displayProperty=fullName> event reaches this element along the event route. See Remarks for <xref:System.Windows.UIElement3D.MouseLeftButtonDown> or <xref:System.Windows.UIElement3D.MouseRightButtonDown>.  \\n  \\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\n>  Some controls might have inherent class handling for mouse button events. The left mouse button down event is the most likely event to have class handling in a control. The class handling often marks the underlying <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse> class event as handled. Once the event is marked handled, other instance handlers that are attached to that element are not ordinarily raised. Any other class or instance handlers that are attached to elements in the bubbling direction towards the root in the UI tree are also not ordinarily raised.  \\n  \\n You can resolve the issue that is outlined in the preceding Important and still receive <xref:System.Windows.UIElement3D.MouseDown> events for left mouse button down events on a derived class that has class handling by using either of these solutions:  \\n  \\n-   Attach handlers for the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement3D.PreviewMouseDown> event, which is not marked as handled by the controls. Notice that because this is a preview event, the route starts at the root and tunnels down to the control.  \\n  \\n-   Register a handler on the control procedurally by calling <xref:System.Windows.UIElement3D.AddHandler%2A> and choosing the signature option that enables handlers to listen for events even if they are already marked as handled in the routed event data.  \\n  \\n <xref:System.Windows.UIElement3D.MouseDown> is introduced in the .NET Framework version 3.5.
