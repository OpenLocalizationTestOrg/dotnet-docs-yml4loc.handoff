  summary: Represents the method that will handle the <xref href="System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsConnecting"></xref> event or <xref href="System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsDisconnecting"></xref> event of a <xref href="System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager"></xref> control.
  remarks: "The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsConnecting> event is raised by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.OnWebPartsConnecting%2A> method, and it signals that the connection process has begun (for example, a user has selected a control and clicked a connect verb), but is not yet completed. The event provides an opportunity to cancel a connection before it is complete. If the connection is successfully completed, this event is followed by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsConnected> event.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsDisconnecting> event is raised by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.OnWebPartsDisconnecting%2A> method, and it signals the fact that a user has clicked a disconnect verb, or the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DisconnectWebParts%2A> method has otherwise been called. The event provides an opportunity to cancel the process of ending a connection before it is complete. If the connection is ended successfully, this event is followed by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsDisconnected> event.  \n  \n The method specified in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnectionsCancelEventHandler> delegate is called when a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsConnecting> or <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsDisconnecting> event is raised.  \n  \n Page developers can add custom handlers for the events by adding the `OnWebPartsDisconnecting` and `OnWebPartsConnecting` attributes to the `<asp:webpartmanager>` element, and assigning custom method names to the attributes. A custom handler can also be assigned programmatically. For more information on programmatically assigning an event handler, see [NIB: How to: Connect Event Handler Methods to Events](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/348e9600-22e3-49a2-8864-11c5bb3e98fc)."
