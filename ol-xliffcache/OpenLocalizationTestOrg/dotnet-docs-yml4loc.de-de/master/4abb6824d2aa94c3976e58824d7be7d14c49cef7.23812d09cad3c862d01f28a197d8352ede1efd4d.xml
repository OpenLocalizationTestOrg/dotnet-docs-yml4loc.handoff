It is an abstract type, or more accurately an infinite set of abstract types, because each of its constructed generic types is an abstract base class. To use <xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.KeyedCollection%602>, derive your collection type from the appropriate constructed type.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.KeyedCollection%602> class is a hybrid between a collection based on the <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IList%601> generic interface and a collection based on the <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IDictionary%602> generic interface. Like collections based on the <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IList%601> generic interface, <xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.KeyedCollection%602> is an indexed list of items. Like collections based on the <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IDictionary%602> generic interface, <xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.KeyedCollection%602> has a key associated with each element.  \\n  \\n Unlike dictionaries, an element of <xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.KeyedCollection%602> is not a key/value pair; instead, the entire element is the value and the key is embedded within the value.  For example, an element of a collection derived from `KeyedCollection\\\\<String,String>` (`KeyedCollection(Of String, String)` in Visual Basic) might be \\\"John Doe Jr.\\\" where the value is \\\"John Doe Jr.\\\" and the key is \\\"Doe\\\"; or a collection of employee records containing integer keys could be derived from `KeyedCollection\\\\<int,Employee>`. The abstract <xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.KeyedCollection%602.GetKeyForItem%2A> method extracts the key from the element.  \\n  \\n By default, the <xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.KeyedCollection%602> includes a lookup dictionary that you can obtain with the <xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.KeyedCollection%602.Dictionary%2A> property.  When an item is added to the <xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.KeyedCollection%602>, the item's key is extracted once and saved in the lookup dictionary for faster searches. This behavior is overridden by specifying a dictionary creation threshold when you create the <xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.KeyedCollection%602>. The lookup dictionary is created the first time the number of elements exceeds that threshold.  If you specify –1 as the threshold, the lookup dictionary is never created.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  When the internal lookup dictionary is used, it contains references to all the items in the collection if `TItem` is a reference type, or copies of all the items in the collection if `TItem` is a value type. Thus, using the lookup dictionary may not be appropriate if `TItem` is a value type.  \\n  \\n You can access an item by its index or key by using the <xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.KeyedCollection%602.Item%2A>property. You can add items without a key, but these items can subsequently be accessed only by index.\"\n  example:\n  - \"This section contains two code examples. The first example shows the minimum code required to derive from <xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.KeyedCollection%602>, and demonstrates many of the inherited methods. The second example shows how to override the protected methods of <xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.KeyedCollection%602> to provide custom behavior.  \\n  \\n **Example 1**  \\n  \\n This code example shows the minimum code necessary to derive a collection class from <xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.KeyedCollection%602>: overriding the <xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.KeyedCollection%602.GetKeyForItem%2A> method and providing a public constructor that delegates to a base class constructor. The code example also demonstrates many of the properties and methods inherited from <xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.KeyedCollection%602> and <xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.Collection%601> classes.  \\n  \\n The `SimpleOrder` class is a very simple requisition list that contains `OrderItem` objects, each of which represents a line item in the order. The key of `OrderItem` is immutable, an important consideration for classes that derive from <xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.KeyedCollection%602>.

The custom behavior provided in this example is a notification event named `Changed`, which is raised at the end of each of the overridden methods.  \\n  \\n The code example creates the `SimpleOrder` class, which derives from <xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.KeyedCollection%602> and represents a simple order form. The order form contains `OrderItem` objects representing items ordered. The code example also creates a `SimpleOrderChangedEventArgs` class to contain the event information, and an enumeration to identify the type of change.  \\n  \\n The code example demonstrates the custom behavior by calling the properties and methods of the derived class, in the `Main` method of the `Demo` class.  \\n  \\n This code example uses objects with immutable keys.

The `MutableKey` class has a settable `Key` property. When a new key is assigned to the property, the property setter calls the `internal` (`Friend` in Visual Basic) `ChangeKey` method of the collection to test whether the new key would conflict with an existing key. If so, an exception is thrown and the property value is not changed.  \\n  \\n In order to maintain the connection between a `MutableKey` object and the `MutableKeys` collection and to prevent an object from being inserted into two collections, the `MutableKey` class has an `internal` (`Friend` in Visual Basic) `Collection` field. This field is maintained by the protected methods that provide custom behavior for adding and removing items from the collection, such as the <xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.KeyedCollection%602.InsertItem%2A> method.

The first example adds a custom notification event and the second provides support for a collection of objects with mutable keys.  \\n  \\n Example 1  \\n  \\n The following code example shows how to override the protected <xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.KeyedCollection%602.InsertItem%2A>, <xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.KeyedCollection%602.RemoveItem%2A>, <xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.KeyedCollection%602.ClearItems%2A>, and <xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.KeyedCollection%602.SetItem%2A> methods, to provide custom behavior for the <xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.Collection%601.Add%2A>, <xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.KeyedCollection%602.Remove%2A>, and <xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.Collection%601.Clear%2A> methods, and for setting the default <xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.Collection%601.Item%2A> property (the indexer in C#).

The order form contains `OrderItem` objects representing items ordered. The code example also creates a `SimpleOrderChangedEventArgs` class to contain the event information, and an enumeration to identify the type of change.  \\n  \\n The code example demonstrates the custom behavior by calling the properties and methods of the derived class, in the `Main` method of the `Demo` class.  \\n  \\n This code example uses objects with immutable keys.
