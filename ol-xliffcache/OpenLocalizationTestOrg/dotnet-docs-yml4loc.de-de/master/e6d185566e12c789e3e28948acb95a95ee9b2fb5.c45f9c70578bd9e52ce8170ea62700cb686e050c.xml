Values set programmatically using the <xref:System.Web.HttpCookie.Secure%2A> property override values set in the Web.config file.  \\n  \\n When dealing with sensitive information, it is strongly recommended that you use HTTPS protocol with SSL encryption. SSL protects against data being altered (data integrity), protects a user's identity (confidentiality), and assures that data originates from the expected client (authentication). For more information on the benefits of encryption, see [Cryptographic Services](~/docs/standard/security/cryptographic-services.md).
