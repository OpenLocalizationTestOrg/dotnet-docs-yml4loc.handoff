You can browse through the source code online, download the reference for offline viewing, and step through the sources (including patches and updates) during debugging; see [instructions](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/).  \n  \n The <xref:System.Array> class is not part of the <xref:System.Collections> namespaces. However, it is still considered a collection because it is based on the <xref:System.Collections.IList> interface.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Array> class is the base class for language implementations that support arrays. However, only the system and compilers can derive explicitly from the <xref:System.Array> class. Users should employ the array constructs provided by the language.  \n  \n An element is a value in an <xref:System.Array>. The length of an <xref:System.Array> is the total number of elements it can contain. The lower bound of an <xref:System.Array> is the index of its first element. An <xref:System.Array> can have any lower bound, but it has a lower bound of zero by default. A different lower bound can be defined when creating an instance of the <xref:System.Array> class using <xref:System.Array.CreateInstance%2A>.A multidimensional <xref:System.Array> can have different bounds for each dimension. An array can have a maximum of 32 dimensions.  \n  \n Unlike the classes in the <xref:System.Collections> namespaces, <xref:System.Array> has a fixed capacity. To increase the capacity, you must create a new <xref:System.Array> object with the required capacity, copy the elements from the old <xref:System.Array> object to the new one, and delete the old <xref:System.Array>.  \n  \n By default, the maximum size of an <xref:System.Array> is 2 gigabytes (GB). In a 64-bit environment, you can avoid the size restriction by setting the `enabled` attribute of the [gcAllowVeryLargeObjects](~/docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/gcallowverylargeobjects-element.md) configuration element to `true` in the run-time environment. However, the array will still be limited to a total of 4 billion elements, and to a maximum index of 0X7FEFFFFF in any given dimension (0X7FFFFFC7 for byte arrays and arrays of single-byte structures).  \n  \n Single-dimensional arrays implement the <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IList%601?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.Collections.Generic.ICollection%601?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable%601?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IReadOnlyList%601?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IReadOnlyCollection%601?displayProperty=fullName> generic interfaces. The implementations are provided to arrays at run time, and as a result, the generic interfaces do not appear in the declaration syntax for the <xref:System.Array> class. In addition,  there are no reference topics for interface members that are accessible only by casting an array to the generic interface type (explicit interface implementations). The key thing to be aware of when you cast an array to one of these interfaces is that members which add, insert, or remove elements throw <xref:System.NotSupportedException>.  \n  \n <xref:System.Type> objects provide information about array type declarations. <xref:System.Array> objects with the same array type share the same <xref:System.Type> object.  \n  \n <xref:System.Type.IsArray%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Type.GetElementType%2A?displayProperty=fullName> might not return the expected results with <xref:System.Array> because if an array is cast to the type <xref:System.Array>, the result is an object, not an array. That is, `typeof(System.Array).IsArray` returns `false`, and `typeof(System.Array).GetElementType` returns `null`.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Array.Copy%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method copies elements not only between arrays of the same type but also between standard arrays of different types; it handles type casting automatically.  \n  \n Some methods, such as <xref:System.Array.CreateInstance%2A>, <xref:System.Array.Copy%2A>, <xref:System.Array.CopyTo%2A>, <xref:System.Array.GetValue%2A>, and <xref:System.Array.SetValue%2A>, provide overloads that accept 64-bit integers as parameters to accommodate large capacity arrays. <xref:System.Array.LongLength%2A> and <xref:System.Array.GetLongLength%2A> return 64-bit integers indicating the length of the array.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Array> is not guaranteed to be sorted.  You must sort the <xref:System.Array> prior to performing operations (such as <xref:System.Array.BinarySearch%2A>) that require the <xref:System.Array> to be sorted.  \n  \n Using an <xref:System.Array> object of pointers in native code is not supported and will throw a <xref:System.NotSupportedException> for several methods.","nodes":[{"pos":[2,404],"content":"[!NOTE]\n To view the .NET Framework source code for this type, see the [Reference Source](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/array.cs#156e066ecc4ccedf).

csharp\n  name: Array\n  nameWithType: Array\n  fullName: System.Array\n  type: Class\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Runtime\n  - mscorlib\n  - netstandard\n  namespace: System\n  summary: Provides methods for creating, manipulating, searching, and sorting arrays, thereby serving as the base class for all arrays in the common language runtime.\n  remarks: \"> [!NOTE]\\n>  To view the .NET Framework source code for this type, see the [Reference Source](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/array.cs#156e066ecc4ccedf). You can browse through the source code online, download the reference for offline viewing, and step through the sources (including patches and updates) during debugging; see [instructions](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/).  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Array> class is not part of the <xref:System.Collections> namespaces. However, it is still considered a collection because it is based on the <xref:System.Collections.IList> interface.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Array> class is the base class for language implementations that support arrays. However, only the system and compilers can derive explicitly from the <xref:System.Array> class. Users should employ the array constructs provided by the language.  \\n  \\n An element is a value in an <xref:System.Array>. The length of an <xref:System.Array> is the total number of elements it can contain. The lower bound of an <xref:System.Array> is the index of its first element. An <xref:System.Array> can have any lower bound, but it has a lower bound of zero by default. A different lower bound can be defined when creating an instance of the <xref:System.Array> class using <xref:System.Array.CreateInstance%2A>.A multidimensional <xref:System.Array> can have different bounds for each dimension. An array can have a maximum of 32 dimensions.  \\n  \\n Unlike the classes in the <xref:System.Collections> namespaces, <xref:System.Array> has a fixed capacity. To increase the capacity, you must create a new <xref:System.Array> object with the required capacity, copy the elements from the old <xref:System.Array> object to the new one, and delete the old <xref:System.Array>.  \\n  \\n By default, the maximum size of an <xref:System.Array> is 2 gigabytes (GB). In a 64-bit environment, you can avoid the size restriction by setting the `enabled` attribute of the [gcAllowVeryLargeObjects](~/docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/gcallowverylargeobjects-element.md) configuration element to `true` in the run-time environment. However, the array will still be limited to a total of 4 billion elements, and to a maximum index of 0X7FEFFFFF in any given dimension (0X7FFFFFC7 for byte arrays and arrays of single-byte structures).  \\n  \\n Single-dimensional arrays implement the <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IList%601?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.Collections.Generic.ICollection%601?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable%601?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IReadOnlyList%601?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IReadOnlyCollection%601?displayProperty=fullName> generic interfaces. The implementations are provided to arrays at run time, and as a result, the generic interfaces do not appear in the declaration syntax for the <xref:System.Array> class. In addition,  there are no reference topics for interface members that are accessible only by casting an array to the generic interface type (explicit interface implementations). The key thing to be aware of when you cast an array to one of these interfaces is that members which add, insert, or remove elements throw <xref:System.NotSupportedException>.  \\n  \\n <xref:System.Type> objects provide information about array type declarations. <xref:System.Array> objects with the same array type share the same <xref:System.Type> object.  \\n  \\n <xref:System.Type.IsArray%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Type.GetElementType%2A?displayProperty=fullName> might not return the expected results with <xref:System.Array> because if an array is cast to the type <xref:System.Array>, the result is an object, not an array. That is, `typeof(System.Array).IsArray` returns `false`, and `typeof(System.Array).GetElementType` returns `null`.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Array.Copy%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method copies elements not only between arrays of the same type but also between standard arrays of different types; it handles type casting automatically.  \\n  \\n Some methods, such as <xref:System.Array.CreateInstance%2A>, <xref:System.Array.Copy%2A>, <xref:System.Array.CopyTo%2A>, <xref:System.Array.GetValue%2A>, and <xref:System.Array.SetValue%2A>, provide overloads that accept 64-bit integers as parameters to accommodate large capacity arrays. <xref:System.Array.LongLength%2A> and <xref:System.Array.GetLongLength%2A> return 64-bit integers indicating the length of the array.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Array> is not guaranteed to be sorted.  You must sort the <xref:System.Array> prior to performing operations (such as <xref:System.Array.BinarySearch%2A>) that require the <xref:System.Array> to be sorted.  \\n  \\n Using an <xref:System.Array> object of pointers in native code is not supported and will throw a <xref:System.NotSupportedException> for several methods.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example shows how <xref:System.Array.Copy%2A?displayProperty=fullName> copies elements between an array of type integer and an array of type <xref:System.Object>.  \\n  \\n [!code-cpp[Classic Array Example#1](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR_Classic/classic Array Example/CPP/source.cpp#1)]\\n [!code-csharp[Classic Array Example#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_Classic/classic Array Example/CS/source.cs#1)]\\n [!code-vb[Classic Array Example#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_Classic/classic Array Example/VB/source.vb#1)]  \\n  \\n The following code example creates and initializes an <xref:System.Array> and displays its properties and its elements.  \\n  \\n [!code-cpp[Classic Array Example#2](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR_Classic/classic Array Example/CPP/source3.cpp#2)]\\n [!code-csharp[Classic Array Example#2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_Classic/classic Array Example/CS/source3.cs#2)]\\n [!code-vb[Classic Array Example#2](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_Classic/classic Array Example/VB/source3.vb#2)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: >-\n      [System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComVisible(true)]\n\n      public abstract class Array : ICloneable, System.Collections.IList, System.Collections.IStructuralComparable, System.Collections.IStructuralEquatable\n  inheritance:\n  - System.Object\n  implements:\n  - System.Collections.IList\n  - System.Collections.IStructuralComparable\n  - System.Collections.IStructuralEquatable\n  - System.ICloneable\n  inheritedMembers:\n  - System.Object.Equals(System.Object)\n  - System.Object.Equals(System.Object,System.Object)\n  - System.Object.GetHashCode\n  - System.Object.GetType\n  - System.Object.MemberwiseClone\n  - System.Object.ReferenceEquals(System.Object,System.Object)\n  - System.Object.ToString\n  extensionMethods:\n  - System.Linq.Enumerable.Cast``1(System.Collections.IEnumerable)\n  - System.Linq.Enumerable.OfType``1(System.Collections.IEnumerable)\n  - System.Linq.ParallelEnumerable.AsParallel(System.Collections.IEnumerable)\n  - System.Linq.Queryable.AsQueryable(System.Collections.IEnumerable)\n  - System.SpanExtensions.AsSpan``1(``0[])\n  - System.SpanExtensions.CopyTo``1(``0[],System.Span{``0})\n  attributes:\n  - type: System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComVisibleAttribute\n  version:\n  - netcore-1.0\n  - netcore-1.1\n  - netcore-2.0\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  - netstandard-1.0\n  - netstandard-1.1\n  - netstandard-1.2\n  - netstandard-1.3\n  - netstandard-1.4\n  - netstandard-1.5\n  - netstandard-1.6\n  - netstandard-2.0\n  - xamarinandroid-7.1\n  - xamarinios-10.8\n  - xamarinmac-3.0\n  monikers:\n  - netcore-1.0\n  - netcore-1.1\n  - netcore-2.0\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  - netstandard-1.0\n  - netstandard-1.1\n  - netstandard-1.2\n  - netstandard-1.3\n  - netstandard-1.4\n  - netstandard-1.5\n  - netstandard-1.6\n  - netstandard-2.0\n  - xamarinandroid-7.1\n  - xamarinios-10.8\n  - xamarinmac-3.0\n  content_git_url: https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/xml/System/Array.xml\n  ms.technology:\n  - dotnet-standard\n  author: mairaw\n  ms.author: mairaw\n  manager: wpickett\n- uid: System.Array.AsReadOnly``1(``0[])\n  commentId: M:System.Array.AsReadOnly``1(``0[])\n  id: AsReadOnly``1(``0[])\n  parent: System.Array\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: AsReadOnly<T>(T[])\n  nameWithType: Array.AsReadOnly<T>(T[])\n  fullName: Array.AsReadOnly<T>(T[])\n  type: Method\n  assemblies:\n  - mscorlib\n  - netstandard\n  - System.Runtime\n  namespace: System\n  summary: Returns a read-only wrapper for the specified array.\n  remarks: \"To prevent any modifications to the array, expose the array only through this wrapper.  \\n  \\n A collection that is read-only is simply a collection with a wrapper that prevents modifying the collection;

Therefore, using `foreach` is recommended, instead of directly manipulating the enumerator.  \\n  \\n Enumerators can be used to read the data in the collection, but they cannot be used to modify the underlying collection.  \\n  \\n Initially, the enumerator is positioned before the first element in the collection. <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Reset%2A> also brings the enumerator back to this position.  At this position, <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Current%2A> is undefined. Therefore, you must call <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> to advance the enumerator to the first element of the collection before reading the value of <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Current%2A>.  \\n  \\n <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Current%2A> returns the same object until either <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> or <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Reset%2A> is called. <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> sets <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Current%2A> to the next element.  \\n  \\n If <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> passes the end of the collection, the enumerator is positioned after the last element in the collection and <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> returns `false`. When the enumerator is at this position, subsequent calls to <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> also return `false`. If the last call to <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> returned `false`, <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Current%2A> is undefined. To set <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Current%2A> to the first element of the collection again, you can call <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Reset%2A> followed by <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A>.  \\n  \\n An enumerator remains valid as long as the collection remains unchanged. If changes are made to the collection, such as adding, modifying, or deleting elements, the enumerator is irrecoverably invalidated and its behavior is undefined.  \\n  \\n The enumerator does not have exclusive access to the collection; therefore, enumerating through a collection is intrinsically not a thread safe procedure.  To guarantee thread safety during enumeration, you can lock the collection during the entire enumeration.  To allow the collection to be accessed by multiple threads for reading and writing, you must implement your own synchronization.  \\n  \\n This method is an O(1) operation.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example shows how to use <xref:System.Array.GetEnumerator%2A> to list the elements of an array.  \\n  \\n [!code-cpp[System.Array_GetEnumerator#1](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.Array_GetEnumerator/CPP/array_getenumerator.cpp#1)]\\n [!code-csharp[System.Array_GetEnumerator#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.Array_GetEnumerator/CS/array_getenumerator.cs#1)]\\n [!code-vb[System.Array_GetEnumerator#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.Array_GetEnumerator/VB/array_getenumerator.vb#1)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public System.Collections.IEnumerator GetEnumerator ();\n    parameters: []\n    return:\n      type: System.Collections.IEnumerator\n      description: An <xref href=\"System.Collections.IEnumerator\"></xref> for the <xref href=\"System.Array\"></xref>.\n  overload: System.Array.GetEnumerator*\n  exceptions: []\n  version:\n  -

The example does this by defining a `ReverseComparer` class that reverses the default sort order for instances of a type and performs case-insensitive string comparison.  \\n  \\n This method uses the introspective sort (introsort) algorithm as follows:  \\n  \\n-   If the partition size is fewer than 16 elements, it uses an [insertion sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort) algorithm.  \\n  \\n-   If the number of partitions exceeds 2 * Log<sup>N</sup>, where  *N* is the range of the input array, it uses a [Heapsort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort) algorithm.  \\n  \\n-   Otherwise, it uses a [Quicksort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort) algorithm.  \\n  \\n This implementation performs an unstable sort; that is, if two elements are equal, their order might not be preserved.
