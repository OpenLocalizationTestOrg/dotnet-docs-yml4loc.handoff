The first component of the tuple is the city name. The second component is the start date of the data series, and the third component is the population at the start date.

The <xref:System.Tuple%608> class represents an *n*-tuple that has eight or more components.  \\n  \\n You can instantiate a <xref:System.Tuple%608> object with exactly eight components by calling the static <xref:System.Tuple.Create%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method. The following example creates an 8-tuple (octuple) that contains prime numbers that are less than 20. Note that it uses type inference to determine the type of each component.  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[System.Tuple.Create#17](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.tuple.create/cs/createntuple.cs#17)]\\n [!code-vb[System.Tuple.Create#17](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.tuple.create/vb/createntuple.vb#17)]  \\n  \\n You can also instantiate an n-tuple object with eight or more components by calling the <xref:System.Tuple%608.%23ctor%2A> constructor. The following example uses the <xref:System.Tuple%608.%23ctor%2A> constructor to create an 8-tuple that is equivalent to the tuple created in the previous example.  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[System.Tuple\\\\`8.Class#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.tuple`8.class/cs/octuple1.cs#1)]\\n [!code-vb[System.Tuple\\\\`8.Class#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.tuple`8.class/vb/octuple1.vb#1)]  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  To create an n-tuple with nine or more components, you must call the  <xref:System.Tuple%608.%23ctor%2A> constructor. The static factory methods of the <xref:System.Tuple> class do not support the creation of `Tuple` objects with more than eight components.  \\n  \\n To instantiate an n-tuple that has eight or more components with the <xref:System.Tuple%608.%23ctor%2A> constructor, you supply a generic `Tuple` object as the `rest` parameter to define the eighth through *n*th components of the tuple. By nesting generic `Tuple` objects in this way, you can create a tuple that has no practical limitation on the number of its components.  \\n  \\n The following example creates a 17-tuple that contains population data for the city of Detroit, Michigan, for each national census from 1860 to 2000. The first component of the tuple is the city name. The second component is the start date of the data series, and the third component is the population at the start date. Each subsequent component provides the population at decade intervals. The 17-tuple is created by nesting a <xref:System.Tuple%603> object inside a <xref:System.Tuple%608> object. (That is, the <xref:System.Tuple%603> object is supplied as the value of the `rest` parameter in the <xref:System.Tuple%608> class constructor.) This <xref:System.Tuple%608> object is, in turn, nested in an outer <xref:System.Tuple%608> object. (That is, the <xref:System.Tuple%608> object is supplied as the value of the `rest` parameter in the outer <xref:System.Tuple%608> object's class constructor.)  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[System.Tuple.Create#19](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.tuple.create/cs/example.cs#19)]\\n [!code-vb[System.Tuple.Create#19](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.tuple.create/vb/example.vb#19)]  \\n  \\n You can retrieve the value of the tuple's first seven components by using the read-only <xref:System.Tuple%607.Item1%2A>, <xref:System.Tuple%607.Item2%2A>, <xref:System.Tuple%607.Item3%2A>, <xref:System.Tuple%607.Item4%2A>, <xref:System.Tuple%607.Item5%2A>, <xref:System.Tuple%607.Item6%2A>, and <xref:System.Tuple%607.Item7%2A> instance properties. Any additional components are nested and can be retrieved from the <xref:System.Tuple%608.Rest%2A> property. In the previous example, the <xref:System.Tuple%608.Item1%2A> through <xref:System.Tuple%608.Item7%2A> properties retrieve the first through seventh components of the tuple. The eighth through fourteenth components are contained in the tuple that is nested at the second level, and are represented by the `Rest.Item1` through `Rest.Item7` properties. The fifteenth through seventeenth components are contained in the tuple that is nested at the third level, and are represented by the `Rest.Rest.Item1` though `Rest.Rest.Item3` properties.  \\n  \\n Tuples are commonly used in four different ways:  \\n  \\n-   To represent a single set of data. For example, a tuple can represent a database record, and its components can represent individual fields of the record.  \\n  \\n-   To provide easy access to, and manipulation of, a data set.  \\n  \\n-   To return multiple values from a method without the use of `out` parameters (in C#) or `ByRef` parameters (in Visual Basic). For example, the previous example returns its computed statistics, along with the city name, in a <xref:System.Tuple%607> object.  \\n  \\n-   To pass multiple values to a method through a single parameter. For example, the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Start%28System.Object%29?displayProperty=fullName> method has a single parameter that lets you supply one value to the method that the thread executes at startup. If you supply a <xref:System.Tuple%607> object as the method argument, you can supply the thread’s startup routine with seven items of data.\"\n  syntax:\n    content: 'public class Tuple<T1,T2,T3,T4,T5,T6,T7,TRest> : IComparable, System.Collections.IStructuralComparable, System.Collections.IStructuralEquatable'\n    typeParameters:\n    -
