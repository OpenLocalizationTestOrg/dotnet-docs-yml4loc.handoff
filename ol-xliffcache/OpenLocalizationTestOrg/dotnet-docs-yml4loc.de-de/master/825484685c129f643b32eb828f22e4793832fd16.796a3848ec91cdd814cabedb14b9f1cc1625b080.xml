The commands only represent the instance of the <xref:System.Windows.Input.RoutedCommand> and not the implementation logic for the command. The implementation logic is bound to the command with a <xref:System.Windows.Input.CommandBinding>. For example, if the <xref:System.Windows.Input.ApplicationCommands.Close%2A> command is executed on a control, the logic which performs the <xref:System.Windows.Input.ApplicationCommands.Close%2A> command may not be provided by the control, so the application writer will be responsible for writing the logic that determines how the control will handle the command.  \\n  \\n Many controls do provide implementation logic for many of the commands in the command library.
