However, positive numbers formatted as strings using the `Format` function don't include a leading space reserved for the sign of the value; those converted using the `Str` function retain the leading space.  \n  \n## Different Formats for Different Numeric Values  \n A user-defined format expression for numbers can have from one to three sections separated by semicolons. If the `Style` argument of the `Format` function contains one of the predefined numeric formats, only one section is allowed.  \n  \n|If you use|This is the result|  \n|-|-|  \n|One section only|The format expression applies to all values.|  \n|Two sections|The first section applies to positive values and zeros; the second applies to negative values.|  \n|Three sections|The first section applies to positive values, the second applies to negative values, and the third applies to zeros.|  \n  \n The following example has two sections: the first defines the format for positive values and zeros; the second section defines the format for negative values. Since the `Style` argument of the `Format` function takes a string, it is enclosed by quotation marks.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrStrings#18](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrStrings/VB/Class1.vb#18)]  \n  \n If you include semicolons with nothing between them, the missing section is printed using the format of the positive value.

These may be used by name as the `Style` argument for the `Format` function:  \n  \n|Format name|Description|  \n|-|-|  \n|`General Number`, `G`, or `g`|Displays number with no thousand separator.<br /><br /> For example, `Format(&H3FA, \"g\")` returns `1018`.|  \n|`Currency`, `C`, or `c`|Displays number with thousand separator, if appropriate; displays two digits to the right of the decimal separator. Output is based on system locale settings.<br /><br /> For example, `Format(1234567, \"c\")` returns `$1,234,567.00`.|  \n|`Fixed`, `F`, or `f`|Displays at least one digit to the left and two digits to the right of the decimal separator.<br /><br /> For example, `Format(1234567, \"f\")` returns `1234567.00`.|  \n|`Standard`, `N`, or `n`|Displays number with thousand separator, at least one digit to the left and two digits to the right of the decimal separator.<br /><br /> For example, `Format(1234567, \"n\")` returns `1,234,567.00`.|  \n|`Percent`|Displays number multiplied by 100 with a percent sign (%) appended immediately to the right; always displays two digits to the right of the decimal separator.<br /><br /> For example, `Format(0.4744, \"Percent\")` returns `47.44%`.|  \n|`P`, or `p`|Displays number with thousandths separator multiplied by 100 with a percent sign (%) appended to the right and separated by a single space; always displays two digits to the right of the decimal separator.<br /><br /> For example, `Format(0.80345, \"p\")` returns `80.35 %`.|  \n|`Scientific`|Uses standard scientific notation, providing two significant digits.<br /><br /> For example, `Format(1234567, \"Scientific\")` returns `1.23E+06`.|  \n|`E`, or `e`|Uses standard scientific notation, providing six significant digits.<br /><br /> For example, `Format(1234567, \"e\")` returns `1.234567e+006`.|  \n|`D`, or `d`|Displays number as a string that contains the value of the number in Decimal (base 10) format. This option is supported for integral types (`Byte`, `Short`, `Integer`, `Long`) only.<br /><br /> For example, `Format(&H7F, \"d\")` returns `127`.|  \n|`X`, or `x`|Displays number as a string that contains the value of the number in Hexadecimal (base 16) format. This option is supported for integral types (`Byte`, `Short`, `Integer`, `Long`) only.<br /><br /> For example, `Format(127, \"x\")` returns `7f`.|  \n|`Yes/No`|Displays `No` if number is 0; otherwise, displays `Yes`.<br /><br /> For example, `Format(0, \"Yes/No\")` returns `No`.|  \n|`True/False`|Displays `False` if number is 0; otherwise, displays `True`.<br /><br /> For example, `Format(1, \"True/False\")` returns `True`.|  \n|`On/Off`|Displays `Off` if number is 0; otherwise, displays `On`.<br /><br /> For example, `Format(1, \"On/Off\")` returns `On`.|  \n  \n### Smart Device Developer Notes  \n The `Yes/No`, `True/False`, and `On/Off` formats are not supported.  \n  \n## User-Defined Numeric Formats  \n The following table identifies characters you can use to create user-defined number formats. These may be used to build the `Style` argument for the `Format` function:  \n  \n|Character|Description|  \n|-|-|  \n|None|Displays the number with no formatting.|  \n|(`0`)|Digit placeholder. Displays a digit or a zero. If the expression has a digit in the position where the zero appears in the format string, display it; otherwise, displays a zero in that position.<br /><br /> If the number has fewer digits than there are zeros (on either side of the decimal) in the format expression, displays leading or trailing zeros. If the number has more digits to the right of the decimal separator than there are zeros to the right of the decimal separator in the format expression, rounds the number to as many decimal places as there are zeros. If the number has more digits to the left of the decimal separator than there are zeros to the left of the decimal separator in the format expression, displays the extra digits without modification.|  \n|(`#`)|Digit placeholder. Displays a digit or nothing. If the expression has a digit in the position where the `#` character appears in the format string, displays it; otherwise, displays nothing in that position.<br /><br /> This symbol works like the `0` digit placeholder, except that leading and trailing zeros aren't displayed if the number has fewer digits than there are `#` characters on either side of the decimal separator in the format expression.|  \n|(`.`)|Decimal placeholder. The decimal placeholder determines how many digits are displayed to the left and right of the decimal separator. If the format expression contains only `#` characters to the left of this symbol; numbers smaller than 1 begin with a decimal separator. To display a leading zero displayed with fractional numbers, use zero as the first digit placeholder to the left of the decimal separator. In some locales, a comma is used as the decimal separator. The actual character used as a decimal placeholder in the formatted output depends on the number format recognized by your system. Thus, you should use the period as the decimal placeholder in your formats even if you are in a locale that uses a comma as a decimal placeholder. The formatted string will appear in the format correct for the locale.|  \n|(`%`)|Percent placeholder. Multiplies the expression by 100. The percent character (`%`) is inserted in the position where it appears in the format string.|  \n|(`,`)|Thousand separator. The thousand separator separates thousands from hundreds within a number that has four or more places to the left of the decimal separator. Standard use of the thousand separator is specified if the format contains a thousand separator surrounded by digit placeholders (`0` or `#`).<br /><br /> A thousand separator immediately to the left of the decimal separator (whether or not a decimal is specified) or as the rightmost character in the string means \"scale the number by dividing it by 1,000, rounding as needed.\" Numbers smaller than 1,000 but greater or equal to 500 are displayed as `1`, and numbers smaller than 500 are displayed as `0`. Two adjacent thousand separators in this position scale by a factor of 1 million, and an additional factor of 1,000 for each additional separator.<br /><br /> Multiple separators in any position other than immediately to the left of the decimal separator or the rightmost position in the string are treated simply as specifying the use of a thousand separator. In some locales, a period is used as a thousand separator. The actual character used as the thousand separator in the formatted output depends on the Number Format recognized by your system. Thus, you should use the comma as the thousand separator in your formats even if you are in a locale that uses a period as a thousand separator. The formatted string will appear in the format correct for the locale.<br /><br /> For example, consider the three following format strings:<br /><br /> -   `\"#,0.\"`, which uses the thousands separator to format the number 100 million as the string \"100,000,000\".<br />-   `\"#0,.\"`, which uses scaling by a factor of one thousand to format the number 100 million as the string \"100000\".<br />-   `\"#,0,.\"`, which uses the thousands separator and scaling by one thousand to format the number 100 million as the string \"100,000\".|  \n|(`:`)|Time separator. In some locales, other characters may be used to represent the time separator. The time separator separates hours, minutes, and seconds when time values are formatted. The actual character used as the time separator in formatted output is determined by your system settings.|  \n|(`/`)|Date separator. In some locales, other characters may be used to represent the date separator. The date separator separates the day, month, and year when date values are formatted. The actual character used as the date separator in formatted output is determined by your system settings.|  \n|(`E-``E+``e-``e+`)|Scientific format. If the format expression contains at least one digit placeholder (`0` or `#`) to the left of `E-`, `E+`, `e-`, or `e+`, the number is displayed in scientific format and `E` or `e` is inserted between the number and its exponent. The number of digit placeholders to the left determines the number of digits in the exponent. Use `E-` or `e-` to place a minus sign next to negative exponents. Use `E+` or `e+` to place a minus sign next to negative exponents and a plus sign next to positive exponents. You must also include digit placeholders to the right of this symbol to get correct formatting.|  \n|`-` `+` `$` ( )|Literal characters. These characters are displayed exactly as typed in the format string. To display a character other than one of those listed, precede it with a backslash (`\\`) or enclose it in double quotation marks (\" \").|  \n|(`\\`)|Displays the next character in the format string. To display a character that has special meaning as a literal character, precede it with a backslash (`\\`). The backslash itself isn't displayed. Using a backslash is the same as enclosing the next character in double quotation marks. To display a backslash, use two backslashes (`\\\\`).<br /><br /> Examples of characters that can't be displayed as literal characters are the date-formatting and time-formatting characters (`a`, `c`, `d`, `h`, `m`, `n`, `p`, `q`, `s`, `t`, `w`, `y`, `/`, and `:`), the numeric-formatting characters (`#`, `0`, `%`, `E`, `e`, comma, and period), and the string-formatting characters (`@`, `&`, `<`, `>`, and `!`).|  \n|(`\"``ABC``\"`)|Displays the string inside the double quotation marks (\" \"). To include a string in the style argument from within code, you must use `Chr(34)` to enclose the text (`34` is the character code for a quotation mark (\")).|  \n  \n### Legacy Code Example  \n The following table contains some sample format expressions for numbers. (These examples all assume that your system's locale setting is English-U.S.) The first column contains the format strings for the `Style` argument of the `Format` function; the other columns contain the resulting output if the formatted data has the value given in the column headings.  \n  \n|Format (`Style`)|\"5\" formatted as|\"-5\" formatted as|\"0.5\" formatted as|  \n|-|-|-|-|  \n|`Zero-length string (\"\")`|`5`|`-5`|`0.5`|  \n|`0`|`5`|`-5`|`1`|  \n|`0.00`|`5.00`|`-5.00`|`0.50`|  \n|`#,##0`|`5`|`-5`|`1`|  \n|`$#,##0;($#,##0)`|`$5`|`($5)`|`$1`|  \n|`$#,##0.00;($#,##0.00)`|`$5.00`|`($5.00)`|`$0.50`|  \n|`0%`|`500%`|`-500%`|`50%`|  \n|`0.00%`|`500.00%`|`-500.00%`|`50.00%`|  \n|`0.00E+00`|`5.00E+00`|`-5.00E+00`|`5.00E-01`|  \n|`0.00E-00`|`5.00E00`|`-5.00E00`|`5.00E-01`|  \n  \n## Predefined Date/Time Formats  \n The following table identifies the predefined date and time format names. These may be used by name as the style argument for the `Format` function:  \n  \n|Format Name|Description|  \n|-|-|  \n|`General Date`, or `G`|Displays a date and/or time. For example, `3/12/2008 11:07:31 AM`. Date display is determined by your application's current culture value.|  \n|`Long Date`, `Medium Date`, or `D`|Displays a date according to your current culture's long date format. For example, `Wednesday, March 12, 2008`.|  \n|`Short Date`, or `d`|Displays a date using your current culture's short date format. For example, `3/12/2008`.<br /><br /> The `d` character displays the day in a user-defined date format.|  \n|`Long Time`, `Medium Time`, or `T`|Displays a time using your current culture's long time format; typically includes hours, minutes, seconds. For example, `11:07:31 AM`.|  \n|`Short Time` or `t`|Displays a time using your current culture's short time format. For example, `11:07 AM`.<br /><br /> The `t` character displays `AM` or `PM` values for locales that use a 12-hour clock in a user-defined time format.|  \n|`f`|Displays the long date and short time according to your current culture's format. For example, `Wednesday, March 12, 2008 11:07 AM`.|  \n|`F`|Displays the long date and long time according to your current culture's format. For example, `Wednesday, March 12, 2008 11:07:31 AM`.|  \n|`g`|Displays the short date and short time according to your current culture's format. For example, `3/12/2008 11:07 AM`.|  \n|`M`, `m`|Displays the month and the day of a date. For example, `March 12`.<br /><br /> The `M` character displays the month in a user-defined date format. The `m` character displays the minutes in a user-defined time format.|  \n|`R`, `r`|Formats the date according to the <xref:System.Globalization.DateTimeFormatInfo.RFC1123Pattern%2A> property. For example, `Wed, 12 Mar 2008 11:07:31 GMT`. The formatted date does not adjust the value of the date and time. You must adjust the Date/Time value to GMT before calling the `Format` function.|  \n|`s`|Formats the date and time as a sortable index. For example, `2008-03-12T11:07:31`.<br /><br /> The `s` character displays the seconds in a user-defined time format.|  \n|`u`|Formats the date and time as a GMT sortable index. For example, `2008-03-12 11:07:31Z`.|  \n|`U`|Formats the date and time with the long date and long time as GMT. For example, `Wednesday, March 12, 2008 6:07:31 PM`.|  \n|`Y`, `y`|Formats the date as the year and month. For example, `March, 2008`.<br /><br /> The `Y` and `y` characters display the year in a user-defined date format.|  \n  \n For more information about the application's current culture information, see [How Culture Affects Strings in Visual Basic](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/strings/how-culture-affects-strings.md).  \n  \n## User-Defined Date/Time Formats  \n The following table shows characters you can use to create user-defined date/time formats.

For example, `Split(\"xx\", \"x\")` returns the array containing three empty strings: one from between the beginning of the string and the first \"x\", one from between the two \"x\" strings, and one from between the last \"x\" and the end of the string.  \n  \n This table demonstrates how the optional `Delimiter`, `Limit`, and `Compare` parameters can change the behavior of the `Split` function.  \n  \n|Split Call|Return Value|  \n|-|-|  \n|`Split(\"42, 12, 19\")`|{\"42,\" , \"12,\" , \"19\"}|  \n|`Split(\"42, 12, 19\", \", \")`|{\"42\", \"12\", \"19\"}|  \n|`Split(\"42, 12, 19\", \", \", 2)`|{\"42\", \"12, 19\"}|  \n|`Split(\"192.168.0.1\", \".\")`|{\"192\", \"168\", \"0\", \"1\"}|  \n|`Split(\"Alice and Bob\", \" AND \")`|{\"Alice and Bob\"}|  \n|`Split(\"Alice and Bob\", \" AND \", ,CompareMethod.Text)`|{\"Alice\", \"Bob\"}|  \n|`Split(\"someone@example.com\", \"@\",1)`|{\"someone@example.com\"}|  \n|`Split(\"someone@example.com\", \"@\",2)`|{\"someone\", \"example.com\"}|  \n  \n The `Compare` argument can have the following values.  \n  \n|Constant|Description|Value|  \n|-|-|-|  \n|`CompareMethod.Binary`|Performs a binary comparison|0|  \n|`CompareMethod.Text`|Performs a textual comparison|1|","nodes":[{"pos":[0,498],"content":"By default, or when `Limit` equals -1, the `Split` function splits the input string at every occurrence of the delimiter string, and returns the substrings in an array.

Output is based on system locale settings.<br /><br /> For example, `Format(1234567, \\\"c\\\")` returns `$1,234,567.00`.|  \\n|`Fixed`, `F`, or `f`|Displays at least one digit to the left and two digits to the right of the decimal separator.<br /><br /> For example, `Format(1234567, \\\"f\\\")` returns `1234567.00`.|  \\n|`Standard`, `N`, or `n`|Displays number with thousand separator, at least one digit to the left and two digits to the right of the decimal separator.<br /><br /> For example, `Format(1234567, \\\"n\\\")` returns `1,234,567.00`.|  \\n|`Percent`|Displays number multiplied by 100 with a percent sign (%) appended immediately to the right; always displays two digits to the right of the decimal separator.<br /><br /> For example, `Format(0.4744, \\\"Percent\\\")` returns `47.44%`.|  \\n|`P`, or `p`|Displays number with thousandths separator multiplied by 100 with a percent sign (%) appended to the right and separated by a single space; always displays two digits to the right of the decimal separator.<br /><br /> For example, `Format(0.80345, \\\"p\\\")` returns `80.35 %`.|  \\n|`Scientific`|Uses standard scientific notation, providing two significant digits.<br /><br /> For example, `Format(1234567, \\\"Scientific\\\")` returns `1.23E+06`.|  \\n|`E`, or `e`|Uses standard scientific notation, providing six significant digits.<br /><br /> For example, `Format(1234567, \\\"e\\\")` returns `1.234567e+006`.|  \\n|`D`, or `d`|Displays number as a string that contains the value of the number in Decimal (base 10) format. This option is supported for integral types (`Byte`, `Short`, `Integer`, `Long`) only.<br /><br /> For example, `Format(&H7F, \\\"d\\\")` returns `127`.|  \\n|`X`, or `x`|Displays number as a string that contains the value of the number in Hexadecimal (base 16) format. This option is supported for integral types (`Byte`, `Short`, `Integer`, `Long`) only.<br /><br /> For example, `Format(127, \\\"x\\\")` returns `7f`.|  \\n|`Yes/No`|Displays `No` if number is 0; otherwise, displays `Yes`.<br /><br /> For example, `Format(0, \\\"Yes/No\\\")` returns `No`.|  \\n|`True/False`|Displays `False` if number is 0; otherwise, displays `True`.<br /><br /> For example, `Format(1, \\\"True/False\\\")` returns `True`.|  \\n|`On/Off`|Displays `Off` if number is 0; otherwise, displays `On`.<br /><br /> For example, `Format(1, \\\"On/Off\\\")` returns `On`.|  \\n  \\n### Smart Device Developer Notes  \\n The `Yes/No`, `True/False`, and `On/Off` formats are not supported.  \\n  \\n## User-Defined Numeric Formats  \\n The following table identifies characters you can use to create user-defined number formats. These may be used to build the `Style` argument for the `Format` function:  \\n  \\n|Character|Description|  \\n|-|-|  \\n|None|Displays the number with no formatting.|  \\n|(`0`)|Digit placeholder. Displays a digit or a zero. If the expression has a digit in the position where the zero appears in the format string, display it; otherwise, displays a zero in that position.<br /><br /> If the number has fewer digits than there are zeros (on either side of the decimal) in the format expression, displays leading or trailing zeros. If the number has more digits to the right of the decimal separator than there are zeros to the right of the decimal separator in the format expression, rounds the number to as many decimal places as there are zeros. If the number has more digits to the left of the decimal separator than there are zeros to the left of the decimal separator in the format expression, displays the extra digits without modification.|  \\n|(`#`)|Digit placeholder. Displays a digit or nothing. If the expression has a digit in the position where the `#` character appears in the format string, displays it; otherwise, displays nothing in that position.<br /><br /> This symbol works like the `0` digit placeholder, except that leading and trailing zeros aren't displayed if the number has fewer digits than there are `#` characters on either side of the decimal separator in the format expression.|  \\n|(`.`)|Decimal placeholder. The decimal placeholder determines how many digits are displayed to the left and right of the decimal separator. If the format expression contains only `#` characters to the left of this symbol; numbers smaller than 1 begin with a decimal separator. To display a leading zero displayed with fractional numbers, use zero as the first digit placeholder to the left of the decimal separator. In some locales, a comma is used as the decimal separator. The actual character used as a decimal placeholder in the formatted output depends on the number format recognized by your system. Thus, you should use the period as the decimal placeholder in your formats even if you are in a locale that uses a comma as a decimal placeholder. The formatted string will appear in the format correct for the locale.|  \\n|(`%`)|Percent placeholder. Multiplies the expression by 100. The percent character (`%`) is inserted in the position where it appears in the format string.|  \\n|(`,`)|Thousand separator. The thousand separator separates thousands from hundreds within a number that has four or more places to the left of the decimal separator. Standard use of the thousand separator is specified if the format contains a thousand separator surrounded by digit placeholders (`0` or `#`).<br /><br /> A thousand separator immediately to the left of the decimal separator (whether or not a decimal is specified) or as the rightmost character in the string means \\\"scale the number by dividing it by 1,000, rounding as needed.\\\" Numbers smaller than 1,000 but greater or equal to 500 are displayed as `1`, and numbers smaller than 500 are displayed as `0`. Two adjacent thousand separators in this position scale by a factor of 1 million, and an additional factor of 1,000 for each additional separator.<br /><br /> Multiple separators in any position other than immediately to the left of the decimal separator or the rightmost position in the string are treated simply as specifying the use of a thousand separator. In some locales, a period is used as a thousand separator. The actual character used as the thousand separator in the formatted output depends on the Number Format recognized by your system. Thus, you should use the comma as the thousand separator in your formats even if you are in a locale that uses a period as a thousand separator. The formatted string will appear in the format correct for the locale.<br /><br /> For example, consider the three following format strings:<br /><br /> -   `\\\"#,0.\\\"`, which uses the thousands separator to format the number 100 million as the string \\\"100,000,000\\\".<br />-   `\\\"#0,.\\\"`, which uses scaling by a factor of one thousand to format the number 100 million as the string \\\"100000\\\".<br />-   `\\\"#,0,.\\\"`, which uses the thousands separator and scaling by one thousand to format the number 100 million as the string \\\"100,000\\\".|  \\n|(`:`)|Time separator. In some locales, other characters may be used to represent the time separator. The time separator separates hours, minutes, and seconds when time values are formatted. The actual character used as the time separator in formatted output is determined by your system settings.|  \\n|(`/`)|Date separator. In some locales, other characters may be used to represent the date separator. The date separator separates the day, month, and year when date values are formatted. The actual character used as the date separator in formatted output is determined by your system settings.|  \\n|(`E-``E+``e-``e+`)|Scientific format. If the format expression contains at least one digit placeholder (`0` or `#`) to the left of `E-`, `E+`, `e-`, or `e+`, the number is displayed in scientific format and `E` or `e` is inserted between the number and its exponent. The number of digit placeholders to the left determines the number of digits in the exponent. Use `E-` or `e-` to place a minus sign next to negative exponents. Use `E+` or `e+` to place a minus sign next to negative exponents and a plus sign next to positive exponents. You must also include digit placeholders to the right of this symbol to get correct formatting.|  \\n|`-` `+` `$` ( )|Literal characters. These characters are displayed exactly as typed in the format string. To display a character other than one of those listed, precede it with a backslash (`\\\\`) or enclose it in double quotation marks (\\\" \\\").|  \\n|(`\\\\`)|Displays the next character in the format string. To display a character that has special meaning as a literal character, precede it with a backslash (`\\\\`). The backslash itself isn't displayed. Using a backslash is the same as enclosing the next character in double quotation marks. To display a backslash, use two backslashes (`\\\\\\\\`).<br /><br /> Examples of characters that can't be displayed as literal characters are the date-formatting and time-formatting characters (`a`, `c`, `d`, `h`, `m`, `n`, `p`, `q`, `s`, `t`, `w`, `y`, `/`, and `:`), the numeric-formatting characters (`#`, `0`, `%`, `E`, `e`, comma, and period), and the string-formatting characters (`@`, `&`, `<`, `>`, and `!`).|  \\n|(`\\\"``ABC``\\\"`)|Displays the string inside the double quotation marks (\\\" \\\"). To include a string in the style argument from within code, you must use `Chr(34)` to enclose the text (`34` is the character code for a quotation mark (\\\")).|  \\n  \\n### Legacy Code Example  \\n The following table contains some sample format expressions for numbers.

For example, `Wed, 12 Mar 2008 11:07:31 GMT`. The formatted date does not adjust the value of the date and time. You must adjust the Date/Time value to GMT before calling the `Format` function.|  \\n|`s`|Formats the date and time as a sortable index. For example, `2008-03-12T11:07:31`.<br /><br /> The `s` character displays the seconds in a user-defined time format.|  \\n|`u`|Formats the date and time as a GMT sortable index.

For example, if you convert #1/1/0001 9:30:00# to a string, the result is \\\"9:30:00 AM\\\"; the date information is suppressed. However, the date information is still present in the original `Date` value and can be recovered with functions such as `DatePart`.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  If you pass the `Expression` argument as a `String` literal, `FormatDateTime` interprets it according to the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture%2A> setting of your application. However, if you pass it as a `Date` literal, use the format #mm/dd/yyyy#, because `FormatDateTime` always interprets a `Date` literal according to the English (US) culture. This is necessary because, if an application is developed and coded using `Date` literals from one culture, but is then executed on a platform with a different culture, the `Date` literals could be parsed incorrectly.  \\n  \\n The `NamedFormat` argument has the following settings.  \\n  \\n|Constant|Description|  \\n|-|-|  \\n|`DateFormat.GeneralDate`|Display a date and/or time. Display a date part as a short date. If there is a time part, display it as a long time. If present, both parts display.|  \\n|`DateFormat.LongDate`|Display a date using the long date format specified in your computer's regional settings.|  \\n|`DateFormat.ShortDate`|Display a date using the short date format specified in your computer's regional settings.|  \\n|`DateFormat.LongTime`|Display a time using the time format specified in your computer's regional settings.|  \\n|`DateFormat.ShortTime`|Display a time using the 24-hour format (hh:mm).|\"\n  example:\n  - \"This example demonstrates the use of the `FormatDateTime` function.  \\n  \\n [!code-vb[VbVbalrStrings#3](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrStrings/VB/Class1.vb#3)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public static string FormatDateTime (DateTime Expression, Microsoft.VisualBasic.DateFormat NamedFormat = Microsoft.VisualBasic.DateFormat.GeneralDate);\n    parameters:\n    - id: Expression\n      type: System.DateTime\n      description: Required. `Date` expression to be formatted.\n    - id: NamedFormat\n      type: Microsoft.VisualBasic.DateFormat\n      description: Optional.
