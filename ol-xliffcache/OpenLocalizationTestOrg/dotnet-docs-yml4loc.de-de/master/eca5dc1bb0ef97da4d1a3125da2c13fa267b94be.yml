  namespace: System.ServiceModel.Channels
  summary: Defines the interface that bindings must implement to describe and advertise the capabilities that clients and services may require.
  remarks: The <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IBindingDeliveryCapabilities> interface must be implemented by a binding if clients and services are to be able to stipulate, as part of their contract, that the features they require are provided by the binding.
  example:
  - "The following sample requires that `CalculatorService` must use a <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSHttpBinding> with ordered message delivery. Reliable sessions and queued delivery are not used by default with this binding, but can be enabled.  \n  \n```csharp  \n<!-- Here is the configuration for a CalculatorService using a WSHttpBinding with ordered message delivery required. -->  \n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>  \n<configuration>  \n   <system.serviceModel>  \n      <services>  \n         <service   \n             type=\"Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples.CalculatorService\">  \n            <!-- Use base address provided by host and a WSHttpBinding named \"Binding1\" -->  \n            <endpoint address=\"\"  \n                      binding=\"wsHttpBinding\"  \n                      bindingConfiguration=\"Binding1\"   \n                      contract=\"Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples.ICalculator\" />  \n         </service>  \n      </services>  \n  \n      <bindings>  \n         <wsHttpBinding>   \n            <binding name=\"Binding1\">           \n               <!-- The next element enables a ReliableSession and required ordered delivery-->  \n      <reliableSession enabled=\"true\" ordered=\"true\"/>  \n      </binding>  \n         </wsHttpBinding>  \n      </bindings>  \n  \n   </system.serviceModel>  \n</configuration>  \n  \n// The CalculatorService configuration has enabled a reliable session  \n// with ordered delivery set to true.

  summary: Gets a value that indicates whether the binding can support assurances for the delivery of messages in the order they were sent.
  remarks: The value of this <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IBindingDeliveryCapabilities.AssuresOrderedDelivery%2A> property is consumed by the <xref:System.ServiceModel.DeliveryRequirementsAttribute.RequireOrderedDelivery%2A> when the description of the service is loaded at runtime. This check is done to determine whether the ordered delivery requirements of the service are satisfied by the binding selected or created for the service.
