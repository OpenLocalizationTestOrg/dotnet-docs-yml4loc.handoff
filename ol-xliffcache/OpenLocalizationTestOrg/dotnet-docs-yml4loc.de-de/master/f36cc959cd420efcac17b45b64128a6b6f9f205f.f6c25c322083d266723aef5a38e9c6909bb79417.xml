System.Windows.Forms\n  namespace: System.Windows.Forms\n  summary: Implements the basic functionality required by a spin box (also known as an up-down control).\n  remarks: \"A spin box consists of a text box and a small vertical scroll bar, commonly referred to as a spin button control. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.UpDownBase> class links the two controls and allows the user to change the display in the text box by clicking the up or down buttons or by entering the appropriate type of value directly into the text box. Use the spin box in cases where you want to limit the list of values a user can select, similar to a list box or combo box. Depending upon the type of list you want to display, the advantage to using a spin box is that it allows you to quickly set a range of valid values, rather than adding items one at a time. Implementing a spin box requires less data validation than a text box, as you can limit the data type when you derive a class from <xref:System.Windows.Forms.UpDownBase>. An example of this is the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.NumericUpDown> class, which limits the values to the numeric type and uses a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.NumericUpDown.Minimum%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.NumericUpDown.Maximum%2A> property to validate the data.  \\n  \\n To allow the user to use the arrow keys to change the contents of a spin box, set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.UpDownBase.InterceptArrowKeys%2A> property to `true`. To restrict the user to values you specify, set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.UpDownBase.ReadOnly%2A> property to `true`. To control the alignment of text in the spin box, set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.UpDownBase.TextAlign%2A> property. To set the alignment of the up and down buttons in relation to the text box portion of the control, set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.UpDownBase.UpDownAlign%2A> property to either <xref:System.Windows.Forms.LeftRightAlignment.Left> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.LeftRightAlignment.Right>.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.UpDownBase.UpButton%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.UpDownBase.DownButton%2A> methods, when overridden, handle the clicking of the up or down buttons. When overridden, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.UpDownBase.ValidateEditText%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.UpDownBase.UpdateEditText%2A> methods validate the value (either selected or entered) and update the text displayed in the spin box. If the value fails validation, use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.UpDownBase.Select%2A> method to select the text that is not valid. This allows the user to quickly correct the text by simply typing in a new value without having to manually select or delete the existing text.  \\n  \\n Starting with the [!INCLUDE[net_2015](~/includes/net-2015-md.md)], the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.UpDownBase> control will be resized based on the system DPI setting when the app.config file contains the following entry:  \\n  \\n```  \\n<appSettings>  \\n  <add key=\\\"EnableWindowsFormsHighDpiAutoResizing\\\" value=\\\"true\\\" />  \\n</appSettings>  \\n  \\n```\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example uses the derived class <xref:System.Windows.Forms.NumericUpDown> and sets some of its properties derived from <xref:System.Windows.Forms.UpDownBase>. This code requires that you have a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.NumericUpDown> control named `numericUpDown1`, two <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox> controls named `comboBox1` and `comboBox2`, and three <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CheckBox> controls named `checkBox1`, `checkBox2`, and `checkBox2` created on a form. Add the following items to `comboBox1`: `None`, `Fixed3D`, and `FixedSingle`. Add the following items to `comboBox2`: `Left`, `Right`, and `Center`.  \\n  \\n The code allows you to change the property values at run time and see how each affects the appearance and behavior of the spin box.  \\n  \\n [!code-cpp[Classic UpDownBase Example#1](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/Classic UpDownBase Example/CPP/source.cpp#1)]\\n [!code-csharp[Classic UpDownBase Example#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/Classic UpDownBase Example/CS/source.cs#1)]\\n [!code-vb[Classic UpDownBase Example#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/Classic UpDownBase Example/VB/source.vb#1)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: >-\n      [System.Runtime.InteropServices.ClassInterface(System.Runtime.InteropServices.ClassInterfaceType.AutoDispatch)]\n\n      [System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComVisible(true)]\n\n      public abstract class UpDownBase : System.Windows.Forms.ContainerControl\n  inheritance:\n  -
