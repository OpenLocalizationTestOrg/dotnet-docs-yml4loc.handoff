You can browse through the source code online, download the reference for offline viewing, and step through the sources (including patches and updates) during debugging; see [instructions](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/).  \n  \n <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> provides forward-only, read-only access to XML data in adocument or stream. This class conforms to the W3C [Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (fourth edition)](http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xml-20060816/) and the [Namespaces in XML 1.0 (third edition)](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/) recommendations.  \n  \n <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader>methods let you move through XML data and read the contents of a node. The properties of the class reflect the value of the current node, which is where the reader is positioned.The <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.ReadState%2A> property value indicates the current state of the XML reader. For example, the property is set to <xref:System.Xml.ReadState.Initial> by the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.Read%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method and <xref:System.Xml.ReadState.Closed> by the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.Close%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method. <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> also provides data conformance checks and validation against a DTD or schema.  \n  \n <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader>uses a pull model to retrieve data. This model:  \n  \n-   Simplifies state management by a natural, top-down procedural refinement.  \n  \n-   Supports multiple input streams and layering.  \n  \n-   Enables the client to give the parser a buffer into which the string is directly written, and thus avoids the necessity of an extra string copy.  \n  \n-   Supports selective processing. The client can skip items and process those that are of interest to the application. You can also set properties in advance to manage how the XML stream is processed (for example, normalization).  \n  \n In this section:  \n  \n [Creating an XML reader](#xmlreader_create)   \n [Validating XML data](#xmlreader_validate)   \n [Data conformance](#xmlreader_data)   \n [Navigating through nodes](#xmlreader_nodes)   \n [Reading XML elements](#xmlreader_elements)   \n [Reading XML attributes](#xmlreader_attributes)   \n [Reading XML content](#xmlreader_content)   \n [Converting to CLR types](#xmlreader_clr)   \n [Asynchronous programming](#xmlreader_async)   \n [Security considerations](#xmlreader_security)  \n  \n<a name=\"xmlreader_create\"></a>   \n## Creating an XML reader  \n Use the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.Create%2A> method to create an <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader>instance.  \n  \n Although the .NET Framework provides concrete implementations of the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> class, such as the <xref:System.Xml.XmlTextReader>, <xref:System.Xml.XmlNodeReader>, and the <xref:System.Xml.XmlValidatingReader> classes, we recommend that you use the specialized classes only in these scenarios:  \n  \n-   When you want to readan XML DOM subtree from an <xref:System.Xml.XmlNode> object, use the <xref:System.Xml.XmlNodeReader> class. (However, this class doesn't support DTD or schema validation.)  \n  \n-   If you must expand entities on request, you don't want your text content normalized, or you don't want default attributes returned, use the <xref:System.Xml.XmlTextReader> class.  \n  \n To specify the set of features you want to enable on the XML reader, pass an <xref:System.Xml.XmlReaderSettings?displayProperty=fullName> object to the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.Create%2A> method. You can use a single <xref:System.Xml.XmlReaderSettings?displayProperty=fullName> object to create multiple readers with the same functionality, or modify the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReaderSettings?displayProperty=fullName>object to create a new reader with a different set of features. You can also easily add features to an existing reader.  \n  \n If you don't use a<xref:System.Xml.XmlReaderSettings?displayProperty=fullName>object, default settings are used. See the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.Create%2A> reference page for details.  \n  \n <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> throws an <xref:System.Xml.XmlException> on XML parse errors. After an exception is thrown, the state of the reader is not predictable. For example, the reported node type may be different from the actual node type of the current node. Use the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.ReadState%2A> property to check whether the reader is in error state.  \n  \n<a name=\"xmlreader_validate\"></a>   \n## Validating XML data  \n To define the structure of an XML document and its element relationships, data types, and content constraints, you use a document type definition (DTD) or XML Schema definition language (XSD) schema. An XML document is considered to be well formed if it meets all the syntactical requirements defined by the [W3C XML 1.0 Recommendation](http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xml-20060816/). It's considered valid if it's well formed and also conforms to the constraints defined by its DTD or schema. (See the [W3C XML Schema Part 1: Structures](http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-1/) and the [W3C XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes](http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/)recommendations.) Therefore, although all valid XML documents are well formed, not all well-formed XML documents are valid.  \n  \n You can validate the data against a DTD, an inline XSD Schema, or an XSD Schema stored in an <xref:System.Xml.Schema.XmlSchemaSet> object (a cache); these scenarios are described on the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.Create%2A> reference page. <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> doesn't support XML-Data Reduced (XDR) schema validation.  \n  \n You use the following settings on the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReaderSettings> class to specify what type of validation, if any, the<xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> instance supports.  \n  \n|Use this <xref:System.Xml.XmlReaderSettings> member|To specify|  \n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|  \n|<xref:System.Xml.XmlReaderSettings.DtdProcessing%2A> property|Whether to allow DTD processing.

DTD processing is disabled by default for <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> objects created by the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.Create%2A> method.  \n  \n     If you have DTD processing enabled, you can use the <xref:System.Xml.XmlSecureResolver> to restrict the resources that the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> can access. You can also design your app so that the XML processing is memory and time constrained. For example, you can configure time-out limits in your ASP.NET app.  \n  \n-   XML data can include references to external resources such as a schema file. By default, external resources are resolved by using an <xref:System.Xml.XmlUrlResolver> object with no user credentials. You can secure this further by doing one of the following:  \n  \n    -   Restrict the resources that the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> can access by setting the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReaderSettings.XmlResolver%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property to an <xref:System.Xml.XmlSecureResolver> object.  \n  \n    -   Do not allow the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> to open any external resources by setting the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReaderSettings.XmlResolver%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property to `null`.  \n  \n-   The <xref:System.Xml.Schema.XmlSchemaValidationFlags.ProcessInlineSchema> and <xref:System.Xml.Schema.XmlSchemaValidationFlags.ProcessSchemaLocation> validation flags of an <xref:System.Xml.XmlReaderSettings> object aren't set by default. This helps to protect the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> against schema-based attacks when it is processing XML data from an untrusted source. When these flags are set, the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReaderSettings.XmlResolver%2A> of the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReaderSettings> object is used to resolve schema locations encountered in the instance document in the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader>. If the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReaderSettings.XmlResolver%2A> property is set to `null`, schema locations aren't resolved even if the <xref:System.Xml.Schema.XmlSchemaValidationFlags.ProcessInlineSchema> and <xref:System.Xml.Schema.XmlSchemaValidationFlags.ProcessSchemaLocation> validation flags are set.  \n  \n     Schemas added during validation add new types and can change the validation outcome of the document being validated. As a result, external schemas should only be resolved from trusted sources.  \n  \n     We recommend disabling the <xref:System.Xml.Schema.XmlSchemaValidationFlags.ProcessIdentityConstraints> flag when validating untrusted, large XML documents in high availability scenarios against a schema that has identity constraints over a large part of the document. This flag is enabled by default.  \n  \n-   XML data can contain a large number of attributes, namespace declarations, nested elements and so on that require a substantial amount of time to process. To limit the size of the input that is sent to the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader>, you can:  \n  \n    -   Limit the size of the document by setting the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReaderSettings.MaxCharactersInDocument%2A> property.  \n  \n    -   Limit the number of characters that result from expanding entities by setting the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReaderSettings.MaxCharactersFromEntities%2A> property.  \n  \n    -   Create a custom `IStream` implementation for the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader>.  \n  \n-   The <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.ReadValueChunk%2A> method can be used to handle large streams of data. This method reads a small number of characters at a time instead of allocating a single string for the whole value.  \n  \n-   When reading an XML document with a large number of unique local names, namespaces, or prefixes, a problem can occur. If you are using a class that derives from <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader>, and you call the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.LocalName%2A>, <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.Prefix%2A>, or <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.NamespaceURI%2A> property for each item, the returned string is added to a <xref:System.Xml.NameTable>. The collection held by the <xref:System.Xml.NameTable> never decreases in size, creating a virtual memory leak of the string handles. One mitigation for this is to derive from the <xref:System.Xml.NameTable> class and enforce a maximum size quota. (There is no way to prevent the use of a <xref:System.Xml.NameTable>, or to switch the <xref:System.Xml.NameTable> when it is full). Another mitigation is to avoid using the properties mentioned and instead use the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.MoveToAttribute%2A> method with the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.IsStartElement%2A> method where possible; those methods don't return strings and thus avoid the problem of overfilling the <xref:System.Xml.NameTable> collection.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Xml.XmlReaderSettings> objects can contain sensitive information such as user credentials. An untrusted component could use the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReaderSettings> object and its user credentials to create <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> objects to read data. Be careful when caching <xref:System.Xml.XmlReaderSettings> objects, or when passing the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReaderSettings> object from one component to another.  \n  \n-   Do not accept supporting components, such as <xref:System.Xml.NameTable>, <xref:System.Xml.XmlNamespaceManager>, and <xref:System.Xml.XmlResolver> objects, from an untrusted source.","nodes":[{"pos":[2,423],"content":"[!NOTE]\n To view the .NET Framework source code for this type, see the [Reference Source](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/#System.Xml/Xml/System/Xml/Core/XmlReader.cs#086471e5cca0825f).

An array containing two strings is returned with the values \"123\" and \"456\".

For example, if an integer array is supplied to the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.ReadContentAs%2A> method call then the string is parsed into an array of integers {123,456}.  \n  \n In the following example the XML text is not separated by spaces  \n  \n```  \n<elem>123<!-- comment --><?pi my_text?>456789<?pi another_pi?></elem>  \n```  \n  \n If the content is untyped and a string array is supplied to the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.ReadContentAs%2A> method call then an array containing one concatenated string is returned with the value \"123456789\".  \n  \n The following table describes how this method treats each node type.  \n  \n|XmlNodeType|Return value|Reader behavior|  \n|-----------------|------------------|---------------------|  \n|`Text`<br /><br /> `CDATA`<br /><br /> `Whitespace`<br /><br /> `SignificantWhitespace`<br /><br /> `EntityReference`<br /><br /> `EndEntity`|Concatenated content of text, CDATA, white space and significant white space nodes converted to the requested type.|Moves to the next start element or end element tag.

The properties of the class reflect the value of the current node, which is where the reader is positioned.The <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.ReadState%2A> property value indicates the current state of the XML reader. For example, the property is set to <xref:System.Xml.ReadState.Initial> by the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.Read%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method and <xref:System.Xml.ReadState.Closed> by the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.Close%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method. <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> also provides data conformance checks and validation against a DTD or schema.  \\n  \\n <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader>uses a pull model to retrieve data. This model:  \\n  \\n-   Simplifies state management by a natural, top-down procedural refinement.  \\n  \\n-   Supports multiple input streams and layering.  \\n  \\n-   Enables the client to give the parser a buffer into which the string is directly written, and thus avoids the necessity of an extra string copy.  \\n  \\n-   Supports selective processing. The client can skip items and process those that are of interest to the application. You can also set properties in advance to manage how the XML stream is processed (for example, normalization).  \\n  \\n In this section:  \\n  \\n [Creating an XML reader](#xmlreader_create)   \\n [Validating XML data](#xmlreader_validate)   \\n [Data conformance](#xmlreader_data)   \\n [Navigating through nodes](#xmlreader_nodes)   \\n [Reading XML elements](#xmlreader_elements)   \\n [Reading XML attributes](#xmlreader_attributes)   \\n [Reading XML content](#xmlreader_content)   \\n [Converting to CLR types](#xmlreader_clr)   \\n [Asynchronous programming](#xmlreader_async)   \\n [Security considerations](#xmlreader_security)  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"xmlreader_create\\\"></a>   \\n## Creating an XML reader  \\n Use the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.Create%2A> method to create an <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader>instance.  \\n  \\n Although the .NET Framework provides concrete implementations of the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> class, such as the <xref:System.Xml.XmlTextReader>, <xref:System.Xml.XmlNodeReader>, and the <xref:System.Xml.XmlValidatingReader> classes, we recommend that you use the specialized classes only in these scenarios:  \\n  \\n-   When you want to readan XML DOM subtree from an <xref:System.Xml.XmlNode> object, use the <xref:System.Xml.XmlNodeReader> class. (However, this class doesn't support DTD or schema validation.)  \\n  \\n-   If you must expand entities on request, you don't want your text content normalized, or you don't want default attributes returned, use the <xref:System.Xml.XmlTextReader> class.  \\n  \\n To specify the set of features you want to enable on the XML reader, pass an <xref:System.Xml.XmlReaderSettings?displayProperty=fullName> object to the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.Create%2A> method. You can use a single <xref:System.Xml.XmlReaderSettings?displayProperty=fullName> object to create multiple readers with the same functionality, or modify the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReaderSettings?displayProperty=fullName>object to create a new reader with a different set of features. You can also easily add features to an existing reader.  \\n  \\n If you don't use a<xref:System.Xml.XmlReaderSettings?displayProperty=fullName>object, default settings are used. See the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.Create%2A> reference page for details.  \\n  \\n <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> throws an <xref:System.Xml.XmlException> on XML parse errors. After an exception is thrown, the state of the reader is not predictable. For example, the reported node type may be different from the actual node type of the current node. Use the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.ReadState%2A> property to check whether the reader is in error state.  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"xmlreader_validate\\\"></a>   \\n## Validating XML data  \\n To define the structure of an XML document and its element relationships, data types, and content constraints, you use a document type definition (DTD) or XML Schema definition language (XSD) schema. An XML document is considered to be well formed if it meets all the syntactical requirements defined by the [W3C XML 1.0 Recommendation](http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xml-20060816/). It's considered valid if it's well formed and also conforms to the constraints defined by its DTD or schema. (See the [W3C XML Schema Part 1: Structures](http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-1/) and the [W3C XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes](http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/)recommendations.) Therefore, although all valid XML documents are well formed, not all well-formed XML documents are valid.  \\n  \\n You can validate the data against a DTD, an inline XSD Schema, or an XSD Schema stored in an <xref:System.Xml.Schema.XmlSchemaSet> object (a cache); these scenarios are described on the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.Create%2A> reference page. <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> doesn't support XML-Data Reduced (XDR) schema validation.  \\n  \\n You use the following settings on the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReaderSettings> class to specify what type of validation, if any, the<xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> instance supports.  \\n  \\n|Use this <xref:System.Xml.XmlReaderSettings> member|To specify|  \\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|  \\n|<xref:System.Xml.XmlReaderSettings.DtdProcessing%2A> property|Whether to allow DTD processing.

DTD processing is disabled by default for <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> objects created by the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.Create%2A> method.  \\n  \\n     If you have DTD processing enabled, you can use the <xref:System.Xml.XmlSecureResolver> to restrict the resources that the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> can access. You can also design your app so that the XML processing is memory and time constrained. For example, you can configure time-out limits in your ASP.NET app.  \\n  \\n-   XML data can include references to external resources such as a schema file. By default, external resources are resolved by using an <xref:System.Xml.XmlUrlResolver> object with no user credentials. You can secure this further by doing one of the following:  \\n  \\n    -   Restrict the resources that the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> can access by setting the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReaderSettings.XmlResolver%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property to an <xref:System.Xml.XmlSecureResolver> object.  \\n  \\n    -   Do not allow the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> to open any external resources by setting the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReaderSettings.XmlResolver%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property to `null`.  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.Xml.Schema.XmlSchemaValidationFlags.ProcessInlineSchema> and <xref:System.Xml.Schema.XmlSchemaValidationFlags.ProcessSchemaLocation> validation flags of an <xref:System.Xml.XmlReaderSettings> object aren't set by default. This helps to protect the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> against schema-based attacks when it is processing XML data from an untrusted source. When these flags are set, the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReaderSettings.XmlResolver%2A> of the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReaderSettings> object is used to resolve schema locations encountered in the instance document in the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader>. If the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReaderSettings.XmlResolver%2A> property is set to `null`, schema locations aren't resolved even if the <xref:System.Xml.Schema.XmlSchemaValidationFlags.ProcessInlineSchema> and <xref:System.Xml.Schema.XmlSchemaValidationFlags.ProcessSchemaLocation> validation flags are set.  \\n  \\n     Schemas added during validation add new types and can change the validation outcome of the document being validated. As a result, external schemas should only be resolved from trusted sources.  \\n  \\n     We recommend disabling the <xref:System.Xml.Schema.XmlSchemaValidationFlags.ProcessIdentityConstraints> flag when validating untrusted, large XML documents in high availability scenarios against a schema that has identity constraints over a large part of the document. This flag is enabled by default.  \\n  \\n-   XML data can contain a large number of attributes, namespace declarations, nested elements and so on that require a substantial amount of time to process. To limit the size of the input that is sent to the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader>, you can:  \\n  \\n    -   Limit the size of the document by setting the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReaderSettings.MaxCharactersInDocument%2A> property.  \\n  \\n    -   Limit the number of characters that result from expanding entities by setting the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReaderSettings.MaxCharactersFromEntities%2A> property.  \\n  \\n    -   Create a custom `IStream` implementation for the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader>.  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.ReadValueChunk%2A> method can be used to handle large streams of data. This method reads a small number of characters at a time instead of allocating a single string for the whole value.  \\n  \\n-   When reading an XML document with a large number of unique local names, namespaces, or prefixes, a problem can occur. If you are using a class that derives from <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader>, and you call the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.LocalName%2A>, <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.Prefix%2A>, or <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.NamespaceURI%2A> property for each item, the returned string is added to a <xref:System.Xml.NameTable>. The collection held by the <xref:System.Xml.NameTable> never decreases in size, creating a virtual memory leak of the string handles. One mitigation for this is to derive from the <xref:System.Xml.NameTable> class and enforce a maximum size quota. (There is no way to prevent the use of a <xref:System.Xml.NameTable>, or to switch the <xref:System.Xml.NameTable> when it is full). Another mitigation is to avoid using the properties mentioned and instead use the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.MoveToAttribute%2A> method with the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.IsStartElement%2A> method where possible; those methods don't return strings and thus avoid the problem of overfilling the <xref:System.Xml.NameTable> collection.  \\n  \\n-   <xref:System.Xml.XmlReaderSettings> objects can contain sensitive information such as user credentials. An untrusted component could use the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReaderSettings> object and its user credentials to create <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> objects to read data. Be careful when caching <xref:System.Xml.XmlReaderSettings> objects, or when passing the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReaderSettings> object from one component to another.  \\n  \\n-   Do not accept supporting components, such as <xref:System.Xml.NameTable>, <xref:System.Xml.XmlNamespaceManager>, and <xref:System.Xml.XmlResolver> objects, from an untrusted source.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following example code shows how to use the asynchronous APIto parse XML.  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[System.Xml.XmlReader.Class#6](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.xml.xmlreader.class/cs/program.cs#6)]\\n [!code-vb[System.Xml.XmlReader.Class#6](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.xml.xmlreader.class/vb/module1.vb#6)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: 'public abstract class XmlReader : IDisposable'\n  inheritance:\n  - System.Object\n  derivedClasses:\n  - System.Xml.XmlDictionaryReader\n  - System.Xml.XmlNodeReader\n  - System.Xml.XmlTextReader\n  - System.Xml.XmlValidatingReader\n  implements:\n  - System.IDisposable\n  inheritedMembers:\n  - System.Object.Equals(System.Object)\n  - System.Object.Equals(System.Object,System.Object)\n  - System.Object.GetHashCode\n  - System.Object.GetType\n  - System.Object.MemberwiseClone\n  - System.Object.ReferenceEquals(System.Object,System.Object)\n  - System.Object.ToString\n  attributes: []\n  version:\n  - netcore-1.0\n  - netcore-1.1\n  - netcore-2.0\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  - netstandard-1.0\n  - netstandard-1.1\n  - netstandard-1.2\n  - netstandard-1.3\n  - netstandard-1.4\n  - netstandard-1.6\n  - netstandard-2.0\n  - xamarinandroid-7.1\n  - xamarinios-10.8\n  - xamarinmac-3.0\n  monikers:\n  - netcore-1.0\n  - netcore-1.1\n  - netcore-2.0\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  - netstandard-1.0\n  - netstandard-1.1\n  - netstandard-1.2\n  - netstandard-1.3\n  - netstandard-1.4\n  - netstandard-1.6\n  - netstandard-2.0\n  - xamarinandroid-7.1\n  - xamarinios-10.8\n  - xamarinmac-3.0\n  content_git_url: https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/xml/System.Xml/XmlReader.xml\n  ms.technology:\n  - dotnet-standard\n  author: mairaw\n  ms.author: mairaw\n  manager: wpickett\n- uid: System.Xml.XmlReader.#ctor\n  commentId: M:System.Xml.XmlReader.#ctor\n  id: '#ctor'\n  parent: System.Xml.XmlReader\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: XmlReader()\n  nameWithType: XmlReader.XmlReader()\n  fullName: XmlReader.XmlReader()\n  type: Constructor\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Xml.ReaderWriter\n  - System.Xml\n  - netstandard\n  namespace: System.Xml\n  summary: Initializes a new instance of the `XmlReader` class.\n  remarks: This constructor is called by derived class constructors to initialize state in this type.\n  syntax:\n    content: protected XmlReader ();\n    parameters: []\n  overload: System.Xml.XmlReader.#ctor*\n  exceptions: []\n  version:\n  - netcore-1.0\n  - netcore-1.1\n  - netcore-2.0\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  - netstandard-1.0\n  - netstandard-1.1\n  - netstandard-1.2\n  - netstandard-1.3\n  - netstandard-1.4\n  - netstandard-1.6\n  - netstandard-2.0\n  - xamarinandroid-7.1\n  - xamarinios-10.8\n  - xamarinmac-3.0\n  monikers:\n  - netcore-1.0\n  - netcore-1.1\n  - netcore-2.0\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  - netstandard-1.0\n  - netstandard-1.1\n  - netstandard-1.2\n  - netstandard-1.3\n  - netstandard-1.4\n  - netstandard-1.6\n  - netstandard-2.0\n  - xamarinandroid-7.1\n  - xamarinios-10.8\n  - xamarinmac-3.0\n  content_git_url: https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/xml/System.Xml/XmlReader.xml\n  ms.technology:\n  - dotnet-standard\n  author: mairaw\n  ms.author: mairaw\n  manager: wpickett\n- uid: System.Xml.XmlReader.AttributeCount\n  commentId: P:System.Xml.XmlReader.AttributeCount\n  id: AttributeCount\n  parent: System.Xml.XmlReader\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: AttributeCount\n  nameWithType: XmlReader.AttributeCount\n  fullName: XmlReader.AttributeCount\n  type: Property\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Xml.ReaderWriter\n  - System.Xml\n  - netstandard\n  namespace: System.Xml\n  summary: When overridden in a derived class, gets the number of attributes on the current node.\n  remarks: This property is relevant to `Element`, `DocumentType` and `XmlDeclaration` nodes only.

Text, white space, significant white space and CDATA sections are concatenated.

See the Remarks section in the<xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> referencepage for a list of the default mappings.  \\n  \\n For example, if you had the following XML text:  \\n  \\n```  \\n<elem>123 <!-- comment --> <?pi my_text?> 456 <?pi another_pi?></elem>  \\n```  \\n  \\n If the data is typed and a string array is supplied to the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.ReadContentAs%2A> method call, then the integer values are converted from strings according to the list of valid CLR type mappings.  \\n  \\n If the data is untyped and a string array is supplied to the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.ReadContentAs%2A> method call, then the content is parsed into separate strings. An array containing two strings is returned with the values \\\"123\\\" and \\\"456\\\". The spaces are not preserved from the content.  \\n  \\n In general when reading untyped data the content is parsed according to the supplied type. For example, if an integer array is supplied to the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.ReadContentAs%2A> method call then the string is parsed into an array of integers {123,456}.  \\n  \\n In the following example the XML text is not separated by spaces  \\n  \\n```  \\n<elem>123<!-- comment --><?pi my_text?>456789<?pi another_pi?></elem>  \\n```  \\n  \\n If the content is untyped and a string array is supplied to the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.ReadContentAs%2A> method call then an array containing one concatenated string is returned with the value \\\"123456789\\\".  \\n  \\n The following table describes how this method treats each node type.  \\n  \\n|XmlNodeType|Return value|Reader behavior|  \\n|-----------------|------------------|---------------------|  \\n|`Text`<br /><br /> `CDATA`<br /><br /> `Whitespace`<br /><br /> `SignificantWhitespace`<br /><br /> `EntityReference`<br /><br /> `EndEntity`|Concatenated content of text, CDATA, white space and significant white space nodes converted to the requested type.|Moves to the next start element or end element tag.

For more information, see RFC 1521, \\\"MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part One: Mechanisms for Specifying and Describing the Format of Internet Message Bodies\\\". You can obtain RFCs from the [Request for Comments Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=37119).  \\n  \\n <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.ReadElementContentAsBase64%2A> can only read simple-content elements. The element can contain text, white space, significant white space, CDATA sections, comments and processing instructions. It can also contain entity references, which are automatically expanded. The element cannot have child elements.  \\n  \\n This method is very similar to the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.ReadContentAsBase64%2A> method except that it can only be called on element node types.  \\n  \\n If the `count` value is higher than the number of bytes in the document, or if it is equal to the number of bytes in the document, the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> reads all the remaining bytes in the document and returns the number of bytes read. The next <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> method call returns a zero and moves the reader to the node following the `EndElement`.  \\n  \\n If you call <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.Read%2A> before all of the element content is consumed, the reader may behave as if the first content was consumed and then the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.Read%2A> method was called. This means that the reader will read all the text until the end element is encountered. It will then read the end tag node, read the next node, and then position itself on the next subsequent node.  \\n  \\n For the asynchronous version of this method, see <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.ReadElementContentAsBase64Async%2A>.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following example reads an inline `Base64` encoded image.

The element can contain text, white space, significant white space, CDATA sections, comments and processing instructions. It can also contain entity references, which are automatically expanded. The element cannot have child elements.  \\n  \\n This method is very similar to the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.ReadContentAsBinHex%2A> method except that it can only be called on element node types.  \\n  \\n If the `count` value is higher than the number of bytes in the document, or if it is equal to the number of bytes in the document, the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> reads all the remaining bytes in the document and returns the number of bytes read. The next <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> method call returns a zero and moves the reader to the node following the `EndElement`.  \\n  \\n If you call <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.Read%2A> before all of the element content is consumed, the reader may behave as if the first content was consumed and then the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.Read%2A> method was called. This means that the reader will read all the text until the end element is encountered. It will then read the end tag node, read the next node, and then position itself on the next subsequent node.  \\n  \\n For the asynchronous version of this method, see <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.ReadElementContentAsBinHexAsync%2A>.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following example reads an inline `BinHex` encoded image.

This method can be called on any node that has a value (<xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.HasValue%2A> is `true`), however actual streaming of the node value only occurs when called on a text, white space and significant white space nodes. Other node type values are cached, including attributes and CDATA nodes.  \\n  \\n This method returns only the content of the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.Value%2A> property and does not move the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader>.  \\n  \\n This method reads the specified number of characters (`count`) of the node value into a character buffer (`buffer`) at a specified offset (`index`) and returns the number of characters written to the buffer. It returns the `0` when it has reached the end of the value. It cannot be restarted to read through the value again.  \\n  \\n In between calls to <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.ReadValueChunk%2A> the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> properties do no change except for the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.Value%2A> property. When the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.Value%2A> property is accessed it may either return a partial value (with characters not yet returned by <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.ReadValueChunk%2A>) or a full value depending on the implementation. All the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> implementations in the <xref:System.Xml> namespace return a partial value for the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.Value%2A> property implementation.  \\n  \\n Any Read method can be called in between calls to <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.ReadValueChunk%2A>. If this occurs, the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> moves to the next <xref:System.Xml.XmlNodeType> in the stream and any characters not yet returned are skipped.  \\n  \\n There may be a case when <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.ReadValueChunk%2A> returns less than the requested number of characters. For example, if you had a 200-character long value with a surrogate pair at positions 127 and 128 and you called <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.ReadValueChunk%2A> with a 128-character buffer, the method call would return 127 characters instead of the requested 128. The surrogate pair would then be returned in the next <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.ReadValueChunk%2A> call. In this case, <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.ReadValueChunk%2A> did not return the requested 128 characters because doing so would have resulted in an incomplete surrogate pair at the end of the buffer.  \\n  \\n For the asynchronous version of this method, see <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.ReadValueChunkAsync%2A>.\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public virtual int ReadValueChunk (char[] buffer, int index, int count);\n    parameters:\n    - id: buffer\n      type: System.Char[]\n      description: The array of characters that serves as the buffer to which the text contents are written.
