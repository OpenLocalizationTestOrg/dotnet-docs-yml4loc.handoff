This grouping of identities is useful in many different applications.  \\n  \\n If data is stored by domain, user, and assembly, the data is private in that only code in that assembly can access the data. The data store is also isolated by the application in which it runs, so that the assembly does not represent a potential leak by exposing data to other applications.  \\n  \\n Isolation by assembly and user could be used for user data that applies across multiple applications; for example, license information, or a user's personal information (name, authentication credentials, and so on) that is independent of an application.  \\n  \\n <xref:System.Security.Permissions.IsolatedStorageContainment> exposes flags that determine whether an application is allowed to use isolated storage and, if so, which identity combinations are allowed to use it. It also determines whether an application is allowed to store information in a location that can roam with a user (Windows Roaming User Profiles or Folder Redirection must be configured).\"\n  example:\n  - \"This example shows how to tell the CLR that code in this assembly requires the <xref:System.Security.Permissions.IsolatedStoragePermission> and also demonstrates how to write and read from isolated storage.  \\n  \\n [!code-cpp[IsolatedStoragePermissionAttribute#1](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR/IsolatedStoragePermissionAttribute/cpp/IsolatedStoragePermissionAttribute.cpp#1)]\\n [!code-csharp[IsolatedStoragePermissionAttribute#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/IsolatedStoragePermissionAttribute/CS/IsolatedStoragePermissionAttribute.cs#1)]\\n [!code-vb[IsolatedStoragePermissionAttribute#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/IsolatedStoragePermissionAttribute/VB/program.vb#1)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: >-\n      [System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComVisible(true)]\n\n      public enum IsolatedStorageContainment\n  inheritance:\n  - System.Object\n  - System.ValueType\n  - System.Enum\n  attributes:\n  - type: System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComVisibleAttribute\n  version:\n  - netcore-2.0\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  - xamarinandroid-7.1\n  - xamarinios-10.8\n  - xamarinmac-3.0\n  monikers:\n  - netcore-2.0\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  - xamarinandroid-7.1\n  - xamarinios-10.8\n  - xamarinmac-3.0\n  content_git_url: https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/xml/System.Security.Permissions/IsolatedStorageContainment.xml\n  ms.technology:\n  - dotnet-standard\n  author: mairaw\n  ms.author: mairaw\n  manager: wpickett\n- uid: System.Security.Permissions.IsolatedStorageContainment.AdministerIsolatedStorageByUser\n  commentId: F:System.Security.Permissions.IsolatedStorageContainment.AdministerIsolatedStorageByUser\n  id: AdministerIsolatedStorageByUser\n  parent: System.Security.Permissions.IsolatedStorageContainment\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: AdministerIsolatedStorageByUser\n  nameWithType: IsolatedStorageContainment.AdministerIsolatedStorageByUser\n  fullName: IsolatedStorageContainment.AdministerIsolatedStorageByUser\n  type: Field\n  assemblies:\n  - mscorlib\n  - System.Security.Permissions\n  namespace: System.Security.Permissions\n  summary: Unlimited administration ability for the user store.
