This configuration section supports setting certain ASP.NET page and control directives globally for all pages and controls in the scope of the configuration file.

For example, if you have a `Page_Load` method in the code for a page, the method will be called in response to the <xref:System.Web.UI.Control.Load> event only if you write code like that in the following example (notice the `Handles` statement in Visual Basic and the event handler code in C#):  \\n  \\n```vb  \\nPartial Class AutoEventWireupExample  \\n    Inherits System.Web.UI.Page  \\n    Protected Sub Page_Load(ByVal sender As Object, _  \\n            ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Me.Load  \\n        Response.Write(\\\"Executing Page_Load\\\")  \\n    End Sub  \\nEnd Class  \\n```  \\n  \\n```csharp  \\npublic partial class AutoEventWireupExample : System.Web.UI.Page  \\n{   \\n    protected void Page_Load(object sender, System.EventArgs e)  \\n    {  \\n        Response.Write(\\\"Executing Page_Load\\\");  \\n    }  \\n    override protected void OnInit(EventArgs e)  \\n    {  \\n        this.Load += new System.EventHandler(this.Page_Load);  \\n    }  \\n}  \\n```  \\n  \\n When <xref:System.Web.Configuration.PagesSection.AutoEventWireup%2A> is `true`, handlers are automatically bound to events at run time based on their name and signature. For each event, ASP.NET searches for a method that is named according to the pattern `Page_`*eventname*, such as `Page_Load` or `Page_Init`. ASP.NET checks first for an overload that has the typical event-handler signature (that is, it specifies <xref:System.Object> and <xref:System.EventArgs> parameters). If an event handler with this signature is not found, ASP.NET checks for an overload that has no parameters.  \\n  \\n When <xref:System.Web.Configuration.PagesSection.AutoEventWireup%2A> is `false`, you must explicitly bind event handlers to events, as shown in the preceding example. In that case, the method names do not have to follow a pattern.  \\n  \\n The default value is `true` if <xref:System.Web.Configuration.PagesSection.AutoEventWireup%2A> is not specified in the `@ Page` directive. Visual Studio automatically includes the attribute when it creates code-behind files. For ASP.NET pages written in C#, Visual Studio sets the value to `true`. For Visual Basic, Visual Studio sets the value to `false` because handlers are bound to events by using the  keyword, which is inserted automatically by Visual Studio when it generates an event handler. If you set <xref:System.Web.Configuration.PagesSection.AutoEventWireup%2A> to `true`, you can omit (or remove) the  keyword.  \\n  \\n Do not set <xref:System.Web.Configuration.PagesSection.AutoEventWireup%2A> to `true` if performance is a key consideration. When automatic event wireup is enabled, ASP.NET must make between 15 and 30 tries to match events with methods.  \\n  \\n Note the following about binding event handlers to events:  \\n  \\n-   If you set <xref:System.Web.Configuration.PagesSection.AutoEventWireup%2A> to `true`, make sure that you do not also manually attach page event handlers to events. If you do, handlers might be called more than one time.  \\n  \\n-   Automatic binding is performed only for page events, not for events for controls on the page.  \\n  \\n-   As an alternative to binding events to handlers, you can override the `On`*eventname* methods of the page or of controls.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example shows how to set or read the <xref:System.Web.Configuration.PagesSection.AutoEventWireup%2A> property in code.  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[System.Web.Configuration.PagesSection#9](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_WebNet/System.Web.Configuration.PagesSection/CS/usingpagessection.cs#9)]\\n [!code-vb[System.Web.Configuration.PagesSection#9](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_WebNet/System.Web.Configuration.PagesSection/VB/usingpagessection.vb#9)]  \\n  \\n The following example shows the two forms of method signatures that are automatically attached to page events when <xref:System.Web.Configuration.PagesSection.AutoEventWireup%2A> is `true`.  \\n  \\n <!-- TODO: review snippet reference [!code-csharp[System.Web.Configuration.PagesSection#50](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_WebNet/System.Web.Configuration.PagesSection/CS/Default.aspx#50)]  -->\\n [!code-csharp[System.Web.Configuration.PagesSection#50](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_WebNet/System.Web.Configuration.PagesSection/CS/Default2.aspx.cs#50)]\\n [!code-vb[System.Web.Configuration.PagesSection#50](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_WebNet/System.Web.Configuration.PagesSection/VB/Default2.aspx.vb#50)]\\n <!-- TODO: review snippet reference [!code-vb[System.Web.Configuration.PagesSection#50](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_WebNet/System.Web.Configuration.PagesSection/VB/Default.aspx#50)]  -->  \\n  \\n The following example shows how to explicitly wire up events when <xref:System.Web.Configuration.PagesSection.AutoEventWireup%2A> is `false`.  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[System.Web.Configuration.PagesSection#51](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_WebNet/System.Web.Configuration.PagesSection/CS/Default.aspx.cs#51)]\\n [!code-vb[System.Web.Configuration.PagesSection#51](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_WebNet/System.Web.Configuration.PagesSection/VB/Default.aspx.vb#51)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: >-\n      [System.Configuration.ConfigurationProperty(\"autoEventWireup\", DefaultValue=Mono.Cecil.CustomAttributeArgument)]\n\n      public bool AutoEventWireup { get; set; }\n    return:\n      type: System.Boolean\n      description: '`true` if events for ASP.NET pages are automatically connected to event-handling functions; otherwise, `false`.
