System.IO.Log\n  namespace: System.IO.Log\n  summary: Provides a generic interface to a sequence of records.\n  remarks: \"The <xref:System.IO.Log.IRecordSequence> interface provides an abstract interface to a record-oriented stream. A <xref:System.IO.Log.IRecordSequence> instance can be used to read and write log records.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.IO.Log.IRecordSequence> interface provides the following capabilities,  \\n  \\n-   Append log records using the <xref:System.IO.Log.IRecordSequence.Append%2A> methods.  \\n  \\n-   Read the appended records using the <xref:System.IO.Log.IRecordSequence.ReadLogRecords%2A> method.  \\n  \\n-   Write a special restart record using the <xref:System.IO.Log.IRecordSequence.WriteRestartArea%2A> method.  \\n  \\n-   Read restart records from the most recently written restart record using the <xref:System.IO.Log.IRecordSequence.ReadRestartAreas%2A> method.  \\n  \\n-   Flush the records to durable store using the  <xref:System.IO.Log.IRecordSequence.Flush%2A> method.  \\n  \\n-   Reserve space for appending records.  \\n  \\n-   Free log space by advancing the base of the log.  \\n  \\n-   Receive <xref:System.IO.Log.IRecordSequence.TailPinned> event notifications to move the base of the log to free space.  \\n  \\n Log records are appended to a <xref:System.IO.Log.IRecordSequence> instance, and each log record is given a unique sequence number. Sequence numbers are strictly monotonically increasing within a given record sequence. A log record consists of opaque data, supplied to the <xref:System.IO.Log.IRecordSequence> instance in an <xref:System.Collections.IList> of ArraySegments of bytes.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.IO.Log.IRecordSequence> interface also exposes a few basic properties which provides information about log boundaries.  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.IO.Log.IRecordSequence.BaseSequenceNumber%2A> property contains the sequence number of the first valid record in the record sequence.  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.IO.Log.IRecordSequence.LastSequenceNumber%2A> property contains a sequence number that is guaranteed to be larger than the sequence number of the last appended record.  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.IO.Log.IRecordSequence.RestartSequenceNumber%2A> property contains the sequence number of the last written restart area.  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.IO.Log.IRecordSequence.MaximumRecordLength%2A> property contains the size of the largest record that can be appended to, or read from the sequence.  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.IO.Log.IRecordSequence.ReservedBytes%2A> property contains the total size of all reservations made in this record sequence.  \\n  \\n-   If the <xref:System.IO.Log.IRecordSequence.RetryAppend%2A> property is set to `true`, and an <xref:System.IO.Log.IRecordSequence.Append%2A> operation fails because there is no space in the sequence, the record sequence will attempt to free space, and retry the Append operation.\"\n  syntax:\n    content: 'public interface IRecordSequence : IDisposable'\n  derivedClasses:\n  - System.IO.Log.FileRecordSequence\n  - System.IO.Log.LogRecordSequence\n  implements:\n  - System.IDisposable\n  version:\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  monikers:\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  content_git_url: https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/xml/System.IO.Log/IRecordSequence.xml\n  ms.technology:\n  - dotnet-standard\n  author: Erikre\n  ms.author: erikre\n  manager: erikre\n- uid: System.IO.Log.IRecordSequence.AdvanceBaseSequenceNumber(System.IO.Log.SequenceNumber)\n  commentId: M:System.IO.Log.IRecordSequence.AdvanceBaseSequenceNumber(System.IO.Log.SequenceNumber)\n  id: AdvanceBaseSequenceNumber(System.IO.Log.SequenceNumber)\n  parent: System.IO.Log.IRecordSequence\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: AdvanceBaseSequenceNumber(SequenceNumber)\n  nameWithType: IRecordSequence.AdvanceBaseSequenceNumber(SequenceNumber)\n  fullName: IRecordSequence.AdvanceBaseSequenceNumber(SequenceNumber)\n  type: Method\n  assemblies:\n  - System.IO.Log\n  namespace: System.IO.Log\n  summary: Moves the base sequence number of the log forward.\n  remarks: When you use a <xref:System.IO.Log.LogRecordSequence> instance and try to advance the sequence number to free up space in the log, the new base sequence number must reside in a different log extent for the previous extent to be marked as empty.
