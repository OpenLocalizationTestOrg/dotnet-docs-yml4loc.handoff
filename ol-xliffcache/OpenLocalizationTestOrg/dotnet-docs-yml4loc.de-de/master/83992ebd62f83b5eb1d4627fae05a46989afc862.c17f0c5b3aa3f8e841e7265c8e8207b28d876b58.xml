It defines an <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IList%601> collection object that stores references to all observers. It also returns a private class named `Unsubscriber` that implements the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface and enables subscribers to stop receiving event notifications.  See the Example section of the <xref:System.IObservable%601> topic for the complete example.  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[System.IObserver.Class#13](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.iobserver.class/cs/provider.cs#13)]\\n [!code-vb[System.IObserver.Class#13](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.iobserver.class/vb/provider.vb#13)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public IDisposable Subscribe (IObserver<out T> observer);\n    parameters:\n    - id: observer\n      type: System.IObserver`1\n      description: The object that is to receive notifications.\n    return:\n      type: System.IDisposable\n      description: A reference to an interface that allows observers to stop receiving notifications before the provider has finished sending them.\n  overload: System.IObservable`1.Subscribe*\n  exceptions: []\n  version:\n  - netcore-1.0\n  - netcore-1.1\n  - netcore-2.0\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  - netstandard-1.0\n  - netstandard-1.1\n  - netstandard-1.2\n  - netstandard-1.3\n  - netstandard-1.4\n  - netstandard-1.5\n  - netstandard-1.6\n  - netstandard-2.0\n  - xamarinandroid-7.1\n  - xamarinios-10.8\n  - xamarinmac-3.0\n  monikers:\n  - netcore-1.0\n  - netcore-1.1\n  - netcore-2.0\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  - netstandard-1.0\n  - netstandard-1.1\n  - netstandard-1.2\n  - netstandard-1.3\n  - netstandard-1.4\n  - netstandard-1.5\n  - netstandard-1.6\n  - netstandard-2.0\n  - xamarinandroid-7.1\n  - xamarinios-10.8\n  - xamarinmac-3.0\n  content_git_url: https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/xml/System/IObservable`1.xml\n  ms.technology:\n  - dotnet-standard\n  author: rpetrusha\n  ms.author: ronpet\n  manager: wpickett\nreferences:\n- uid: System.IObservable`1.Subscribe(System.IObserver{`0})\n  parent: System.IObservable`1\n  isExternal: false\n  name: Subscribe(IObserver<T>)\n  nameWithType: IObservable<T>.Subscribe(IObserver<T>)\n  fullName: IObservable<T>.Subscribe(IObserver<T>)\n- uid: System.IDisposable\n  parent: System\n  isExternal: false\n  name: IDisposable\n  nameWithType: IDisposable\n  fullName: System.IDisposable\n- uid: System.IObserver`1\n  parent: System\n  isExternal: false\n  name: IObserver<T>\n  nameWithType: IObserver<T>\n  fullName: System.IObserver<T>\n- uid: System.IObservable`1.Subscribe*\n  parent: System.IObservable`1\n  isExternal: false\n  name: Subscribe\n  nameWithType: IObservable<T>.Subscribe\n  fullName: IObservable<T>.Subscribe\n  monikers:\n  - netcore-1.0\n  - netcore-1.1\n  - netcore-2.0\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  - netstandard-1.0\n  - netstandard-1.1\n  - netstandard-1.2\n  - netstandard-1.3\n  - netstandard-1.4\n  - netstandard-1.5\n  - netstandard-1.6\n  - netstandard-2.0\n  - xamarinandroid-7.1\n  - xamarinios-10.8\n  - xamarinmac-3.0\n  content_git_url: https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/xml/System/IObservable`1.xml\n"}
