The meaning of the comparisons specified in the Return Value section (\\\"precedes\\\", \\\"occurs in the same position as\\\", and \\\"follows\\\") depends on the particular implementation.  \\n  \\n By definition, any object compares greater than (or follows) `null`, and two null references compare equal to each other.  \\n  \\n The parameter, `obj`, must be the same type as the class or value type that implements this interface; otherwise, an <xref:System.ArgumentException> is thrown.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following example illustrates the use of <xref:System.IComparable.CompareTo%2A> to compare a `Temperature` object implementing <xref:System.IComparable> with another object. The `Temperature` object implements <xref:System.IComparable.CompareTo%2A> by simply wrapping a call to the <xref:System.Int32.CompareTo%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method.  \\n  \\n [!code-cpp[IComparable Example#1](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR/IComparable Example/CPP/source.cpp#1)]\\n [!code-csharp[IComparable Example#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/IComparable Example/CS/source.cs#1)]\\n [!code-vb[IComparable Example#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/IComparable Example/VB/source.vb#1)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public int CompareTo (object obj);\n    parameters:\n    - id: obj\n      type: System.Object\n      description: An object to compare with this instance.\n    return:\n      type: System.Int32\n      description: \"A value that indicates the relative order of the objects being compared.
