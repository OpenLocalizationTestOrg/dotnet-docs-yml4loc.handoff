The commands only represent the instance of the <xref:System.Windows.Input.RoutedCommand> and not the implementation logic for the command. The implementation logic is bound to the command via a <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.CommandBindings%2A>. For example, if the <xref:System.Windows.Input.ComponentCommands.MoveLeft%2A> command is executed on a control (the command target), the logic that performs the <xref:System.Windows.Input.ComponentCommands.MoveLeft%2A> command may not be provided by the command target, so the application writer is responsible for writing the logic that determines how the command target handles the command.  \\n  \\n Many controls do provide implementation logic, though, for many of the commands in the command library.  For example, the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox> class provides logic for the <xref:System.Windows.Input.ApplicationCommands.Paste%2A> command, <xref:System.Windows.Input.ApplicationCommands.Cut%2A> command, <xref:System.Windows.Input.ApplicationCommands.Copy%2A> command, <xref:System.Windows.Input.ApplicationCommands.Undo%2A> command, and <xref:System.Windows.Input.ApplicationCommands.Redo%2A> command.
