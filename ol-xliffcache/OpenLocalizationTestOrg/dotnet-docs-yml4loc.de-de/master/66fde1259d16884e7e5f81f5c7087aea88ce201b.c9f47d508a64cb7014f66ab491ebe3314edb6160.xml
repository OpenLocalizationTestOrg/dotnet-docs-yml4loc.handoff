<xref:System.Web.HttpBrowserCapabilitiesBase> class is an abstract class that contains the same members as the <xref:System.Web.HttpBrowserCapabilities> class. The <xref:System.Web.HttpBrowserCapabilitiesBase> class enables you to create derived classes that are like the <xref:System.Web.HttpBrowserCapabilities> class, but that you can customize and that work outside the ASP.NET pipeline. When you perform unit testing, you typically use a derived class to implement members with customized behavior that fulfills the scenario you are testing.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Web.HttpBrowserCapabilitiesWrapper> class derives from the <xref:System.Web.HttpBrowserCapabilitiesBase> class. The <xref:System.Web.HttpBrowserCapabilitiesWrapper> class serves as a wrapper for the <xref:System.Web.HttpBrowserCapabilities> class.
