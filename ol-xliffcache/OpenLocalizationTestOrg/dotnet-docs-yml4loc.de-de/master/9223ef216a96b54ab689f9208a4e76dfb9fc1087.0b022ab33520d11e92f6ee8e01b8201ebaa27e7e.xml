You can browse through the source code online, download the reference for offline viewing, and step through the sources (including patches and updates) during debugging; see [instructions](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/).  \n  \n A <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> component provides access to a process that is running on a computer. A process, in the simplest terms, is a running app. A thread is the basic unit to which the operating system allocates processor time. A thread can execute any part of the code of the process, including parts currently being executed by another thread.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> component is a useful tool for starting, stopping, controlling, and monitoring apps. You can use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> component, to obtain a list of the processes that are running, or you can start a new process. A <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> component is used to access system processes. After a <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> component has been initialized, it can be used to obtain information about the running process. Such information includes the set of threads, the loaded modules (.dll and .exe files), and performance information such as the amount of memory the process is using.  \n  \n This type implements the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface. When you have finished using the type, you should dispose of it either directly or indirectly. To dispose of the type directly, call its <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method in a `try`/`catch` block. To dispose of it indirectly, use a language construct such as `using` (in C#) or `Using` (in Visual Basic). For more information, see the \"Using an Object that Implements IDisposable\" section in the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface topic.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  32-bit processes cannot access the modules of a 64-bit process. If you try to get information about a 64-bit process from a 32-bit process, you will get a <xref:System.ComponentModel.Win32Exception> exception. A 64-bit process, on the other hand, can access the modules of a 32-bit process.  \n  \n The process component obtains information about a group of properties all at once. After the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> component has obtained information about one member of any group, it will cache the values for the other properties in that group and not obtain new information about the other members of the group until you call the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Refresh%2A> method. Therefore, a property value is not guaranteed to be any newer than the last call to the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Refresh%2A> method. The group breakdowns are operating-system dependent.  \n  \n If you have a path variable declared in your system using quotes, you must fully qualify that path when starting any process found in that location. Otherwise, the system will not find the path. For example, if `c:\\mypath` is not in your path, and you add it using quotation marks: `path = %path%;\"c:\\mypath\"`, you must fully qualify any process in `c:\\mypath` when starting it.  \n  \n A system process is uniquely identified on the system by its process identifier. Like many Windows resources, a process is also identified by its handle, which might not be unique on the computer. A handle is the generic term for an identifier of a resource. The operating system persists the process handle, which is accessed through the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Handle%2A> property of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> component, even when the process has exited. Thus, you can get the process's administrative information, such as the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.ExitCode%2A> (usually either zero for success or a nonzero error code) and the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.ExitTime%2A>. Handles are an extremely valuable resource, so leaking handles is more virulent than leaking memory.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This class contains a link demand and an inheritance demand at the class level that applies to all members. A <xref:System.Security.SecurityException> is thrown when either the immediate caller or the derived class does not have full-trust permission. For details about security demands, see [Link Demands](~/docs/framework/misc/link-demands.md).  \n  \n<a name=\"Core\"></a>   \n## [!INCLUDE[net_core](~/includes/net-core-md.md)] Notes  \n In the .NET Framework on the desktop, the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> class by default uses <xref:System.Console> encodings, which are typically code page encodings, for the input, output, and error streams. For example code, on systems whose culture is English (United States), code page 437 is the default encoding for the <xref:System.Console> class. However, [!INCLUDE[net_core](~/includes/net-core-md.md)] may make only a limited subset of these encodings available. If this is the case, it uses <xref:System.Text.Encoding.UTF8%2A?displayProperty=fullName> as the default encoding.  \n  \n If a <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> object depends on specific code page encodings, you can still make them available by doing the following *before* you call any <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> methods:  \n  \n1.  Add a reference to the System.Text.Encoding.CodePages.dll assembly to your project.  \n  \n2.  Retrieve the <xref:System.Text.EncodingProvider> object from the <xref:System.Text.CodePagesEncodingProvider.Instance%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property.  \n  \n3.  Pass the <xref:System.Text.EncodingProvider> object to the <xref:System.Text.Encoding.RegisterProvider%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method to make the additional encodings supported by the encoding provider available.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> class will then automatically use the default system encoding rather than UTF8, provided that you have registered the encoding provider before calling any <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> methods.","nodes":[{"pos":[2,437],"content":"[!NOTE]\n To view the .NET Framework source code for this type, see the [Reference Source](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/#System/services/monitoring/system/diagnosticts/Process.cs#f8b2e604d6f1fe04).

By redirecting the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardError%2A> stream, you can manipulate or suppress the error output of a process. For example, you can filter the text, format it differently, or write the output to both the console and a designated log file.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  To use <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardError%2A>, you must set <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.UseShellExecute%2A?displayProperty=fullName> to `false`, and you must set <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.RedirectStandardError%2A?displayProperty=fullName> to `true`. Otherwise, reading from the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardError%2A> stream throws an exception.  \n  \n The redirected <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardError%2A> stream can be read synchronously or asynchronously. Methods such as <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.Read%2A>, <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.ReadLine%2A>, and <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.ReadToEnd%2A> perform synchronous read operations on the error output stream of the process. These synchronous read operations do not complete until the associated <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> writes to its <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardError%2A> stream, or closes the stream.  \n  \n In contrast, <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.BeginErrorReadLine%2A> starts asynchronous read operations on the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardError%2A> stream. This method enables a designated event handler for the stream output and immediately returns to the caller, which can perform other work while the stream output is directed to the event handler.  \n  \n Synchronous read operations introduce a dependency between the caller reading from the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardError%2A> stream and the child process writing to that stream. These dependencies can result in deadlock conditions. When the caller reads from the redirected stream of a child process, it is dependent on the child. The caller waits on the read operation until the child writes to the stream or closes the stream. When the child process writes enough data to fill its redirected stream, it is dependent on the parent. The child process waits on the next write operation until the parent reads from the full stream or closes the stream. The deadlock condition results when the caller and child process wait on each other to complete an operation, and neither can proceed. You can avoid deadlocks by evaluating dependencies between the caller and child process.  \n  \n The following C# code, for example, shows how to read from a redirected stream and wait for the child process to exit.  \n  \n```  \n// Start the child process.  \n Process p = new Process();  \n // Redirect the error stream of the child process.  \n p.StartInfo.UseShellExecute = false;  \n p.StartInfo.RedirectStandardError = true;  \n p.StartInfo.FileName = \"Write500Lines.exe\";  \n p.Start();  \n // Do not wait for the child process to exit before  \n // reading to the end of its redirected error stream.  \n // p.WaitForExit();  \n // Read the error stream first and then wait.  \n string error = p.StandardError.ReadToEnd();  \n p.WaitForExit();  \n```  \n  \n The code example avoids a deadlock condition by calling `p.StandardError.ReadToEnd` before `p.WaitForExit`. A deadlock condition can result if the parent process calls `p.WaitForExit` before `p.StandardError.ReadToEnd` and the child process writes enough text to fill the redirected stream. The parent process would wait indefinitely for the child process to exit. The child process would wait indefinitely for the parent to read from the full <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardError%2A> stream.  \n  \n There is a similar issue when you read all text from both the standard output and standard error streams. The following C# code, for example, performs a read operation on both streams.  \n  \n```  \n// Do not perform a synchronous read to the end of both   \n// redirected streams.  \n// string output = p.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd();  \n// string error = p.StandardError.ReadToEnd();  \n// p.WaitForExit();  \n// Use asynchronous read operations on at least one of the streams.  \np.BeginOutputReadLine();  \nstring error = p.StandardError.ReadToEnd();  \np.WaitForExit();  \n```  \n  \n The code example avoids the deadlock condition by performing asynchronous read operations on the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardOutput%2A> stream. A deadlock condition results if the parent process calls `p.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd` followed by `p.StandardError.ReadToEnd` and the child process writes enough text to fill its error stream. The parent process would wait indefinitely for the child process to close its <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardOutput%2A> stream. The child process would wait indefinitely for the parent to read from the full <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardError%2A> stream.  \n  \n You can use asynchronous read operations to avoid these dependencies and their deadlock potential. Alternately, you can avoid the deadlock condition by creating two threads and reading the output of each stream on a separate thread.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  You cannot mix asynchronous and synchronous read operations on a redirected stream. Once the redirected stream of a <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> is opened in either asynchronous or synchronous mode, all further read operations on that stream must be in the same mode. For example, do not follow <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.BeginErrorReadLine%2A> with a call to <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.ReadLine%2A> on the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardError%2A> stream, or vice versa. However, you can read two different streams in different modes. For example, you can call <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.BeginOutputReadLine%2A> and then call <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.ReadLine%2A> for the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardError%2A> stream.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,398],"content":"When a <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> writes text to its standard error stream, that text is normally displayed on the console.

Otherwise, reading from the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardOutput%2A> stream throws an exception.  \n  \n The redirected <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardOutput%2A> stream can be read synchronously or asynchronously. Methods such as <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.Read%2A>, <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.ReadLine%2A>, and <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.ReadToEnd%2A> perform synchronous read operations on the output stream of the process. These synchronous read operations do not complete until the associated <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> writes to its <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardOutput%2A> stream, or closes the stream.  \n  \n In contrast, <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.BeginOutputReadLine%2A> starts asynchronous read operations on the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardOutput%2A> stream. This method enables a designated event handler for the stream output and immediately returns to the caller, which can perform other work while the stream output is directed to the event handler.  \n  \n Synchronous read operations introduce a dependency between the caller reading from the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardOutput%2A> stream and the child process writing to that stream. These dependencies can result in deadlock conditions. When the caller reads from the redirected stream of a child process, it is dependent on the child. The caller waits on the read operation until the child writes to the stream or closes the stream. When the child process writes enough data to fill its redirected stream, it is dependent on the parent. The child process waits on the next write operation until the parent reads from the full stream or closes the stream. The deadlock condition results when the caller and child process wait on each other to complete an operation, and neither can proceed. You can avoid deadlocks by evaluating dependencies between the caller and child process.  \n  \n The following C# code, for example, shows how to read from a redirected stream and wait for the child process to exit.  \n  \n```  \nProcess p = new Process();  \np.StartInfo.UseShellExecute = false;  \np.StartInfo.RedirectStandardOutput = true;  \np.StartInfo.FileName = \"Write500Lines.exe\";  \np.Start();  \n  \n// To avoid deadlocks, always read the output stream first and then wait.  \nstring output = p.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd();  \np.WaitForExit();  \n```  \n  \n The code example avoids a deadlock condition by calling `p.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd` before `p.WaitForExit`. A deadlock condition can result if the parent process calls `p.WaitForExit` before `p.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd` and the child process writes enough text to fill the redirected stream. The parent process would wait indefinitely for the child process to exit. The child process would wait indefinitely for the parent to read from the full <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardOutput%2A> stream.  \n  \n There is a similar issue when you read all text from both the standard output and standard error streams. The following C# code, for example, performs a read operation on both streams.  \n  \n```  \n// To avoid deadlocks, use asynchronous read operations on at least one of the streams.  \n// Do not perform a synchronous read to the end of both redirected streams.  \np.BeginOutputReadLine();  \nstring error = p.StandardError.ReadToEnd();  \np.WaitForExit();  \n```  \n  \n The code example avoids the deadlock condition by performing asynchronous read operations on the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardOutput%2A> stream. A deadlock condition results if the parent process calls `p.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd` followed by `p.StandardError.ReadToEnd` and the child process writes enough text to fill its error stream. The parent process would wait indefinitely for the child process to close its <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardOutput%2A> stream. The child process would wait indefinitely for the parent to read from the full <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardError%2A> stream.  \n  \n You can use asynchronous read operations to avoid these dependencies and their deadlock potential. Alternately, you can avoid the deadlock condition by creating two threads and reading the output of each stream on a separate thread.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  You cannot mix asynchronous and synchronous read operations on a redirected stream. Once the redirected stream of a <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> is opened in either asynchronous or synchronous mode, all further read operations on that stream must be in the same mode.

Use the `Properties` window to expand the `StartInfo` category and write the appropriate value into the `FileName` property. Your changes will appear in the form's `InitializeComponent` procedure.  \n  \n This overload of <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> is not a `static` method. You must call it from an instance of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> class. Before calling <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A>, you must first specify <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StartInfo%2A> property information for this <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> instance, because that information is used to determine the process resource to start.  \n  \n The other overloads of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> method are `static` members. You do not need to create an instance of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> component before you call those overloads of the method. Instead, you can call <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> for the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> class itself, and a new <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> component is created if the process was started. Or, `null` is returned if a process was reused. The process resource is automatically associated with the new <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> component that is returned by the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> method.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StartInfo%2A> members can be used to duplicate the functionality of the `Run` dialog box of the Windows `Start` menu. Anything that can be typed into a command line can be started by setting the appropriate values in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StartInfo%2A> property. The only <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StartInfo%2A> property that must be set is the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> property. The <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> property does not have to be an executable file. It can be of any file type for which the extension has been associated with an application that is installed on the system. For example, the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> property can have a .txt extension if you have associated text files with an editor, such as Notepad, or it can have a .doc extension if you have associated.doc files with a word processing tool, such as Microsoft Word.  \n  \n In the command line, you can specify actions to take for certain types of files. For example, you can print documents or edit text files. Specify these actions using the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.Verb%2A> member of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StartInfo%2A> property. For other types of files, you can specify command-line arguments when you start the file from the `Run` dialog box. For example, you can pass a URL as an argument if you specify your browser as the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A>. These arguments can be specified in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StartInfo%2A> property's <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.Arguments%2A> member.  \n  \n If you have a path variable declared in your system using quotes, you must fully qualify that path when starting any process found in that location. Otherwise, the system will not find the path. For example, if `c:\\mypath` is not in your path, and you add it using quotation marks: `path = %path%;\"c:\\mypath\"`, you must fully qualify any process in `c:\\mypath` when starting it.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  ASP.NET Web page and server control code executes in the context of the ASP.NET worker process on the Web server.  If you use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> method in an ASP.NET Web page or server control, the new process executes on the Web server with restricted permissions. The process does not start in the same context as the client browser, and does not have access to the user desktop.  \n  \n Whenever you use <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> to start a process, you might need to close it or you risk losing system resources. Close processes using <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.CloseMainWindow%2A> or <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Kill%2A>. You can check whether a process has already been closed by using its <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.HasExited%2A> property.  \n  \n A note about apartment states in managed threads is necessary here. When <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.UseShellExecute%2A> is `true` on the process component's <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StartInfo%2A> property, make sure you have set a threading model on your application by setting the attribute `[STAThread]` on the `main()` method. Otherwise, a managed thread can be in an `unknown` state or put in the `MTA` state, the latter of which conflicts with <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.UseShellExecute%2A> being `true`. Some methods require that the apartment state not be `unknown`. If the state is not explicitly set, when the application encounters such a method, it defaults to `MTA`, and once set, the apartment state cannot be changed. However, `MTA` causes an exception to be thrown when the operating system shell is managing the thread.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,517],"content":"Use this overload to start a process resource and associate it with the current <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> component.

Using this overload with a <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo> parameter is an alternative to the explicit steps of creating a new <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> instance, setting its <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StartInfo%2A> properties, and calling <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> for the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> instance.  \n  \n Using a <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo> instance as the parameter lets you call <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> with the most control over what is passed into the call to start the process.

The <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> property does not need to represent an executable file. It can be of any file type for which the extension has been associated with an application that is installed on the system. For example, the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> property can have a .txt extension if you have associated text files with an editor, such as Notepad, or it can have a .doc extension if you have associated.doc files with a word processing tool, such as Microsoft Word.  \n  \n You can start a ClickOnce application by specifying the location (for example, a Web address) from which you originally installed the application. Do not start a ClickOnce application by specifying its installed location on your hard drive.  \n  \n If the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.UserName%2A> and <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.Password%2A> properties of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StartInfo%2A> instance are set, the unmanaged `CreateProcessWithLogonW` function is called, which starts the process in a new window even if the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.CreateNoWindow%2A> property value is `true` or the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.WindowStyle%2A> property value is <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessWindowStyle.Hidden>.  \n  \n Unlike the other overloads, the overload of <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> that has no parameters is not a `static` member. Use that overload when you have already created a <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> instance, specified start information (including the file name), and want to start a process resource and associate it with the existing <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> instance. Use one of the `static` overloads when you want to create a new <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> component rather than start a process for an existing component. Both this overload and the overload that has no parameters allow you to specify the start information for the process resource by using a <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo> instance.  \n  \n If you have a path variable declared in your system using quotes, you must fully qualify that path when starting any process found in that location. Otherwise, the system will not find the path. For example, if `c:\\mypath` is not in your path, and you add it using quotation marks: `path = %path%;\"c:\\mypath\"`, you must fully qualify any process in `c:\\mypath` when starting it.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  ASP.NET Web page and server control code executes in the context of the ASP.NET worker process on the Web server.  If you use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> method in an ASP.NET Web page or server control, the new process executes on the Web server with restricted permissions. The process does not start in the same context as the client browser, and does not have access to the user desktop.  \n  \n Whenever you use <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> to start a process, you might need to close it or you risk losing system resources. Close processes using <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.CloseMainWindow%2A> or <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Kill%2A>.

When <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.UseShellExecute%2A> is `true` on the `startInfo` parameter, make sure you have set a threading model on your application by setting the attribute `[STAThread]` on the `main()` method. Otherwise, a managed thread can be in an `unknown` state or put in the `MTA` state, the latter of which conflicts with <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.UseShellExecute%2A> being `true`. Some methods require that the apartment state not be `unknown`.

The overload is an alternative to the explicit steps of creating a new <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> instance, setting the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> member of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StartInfo%2A> property, and calling <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> for the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> instance.  \n  \n You can start a ClickOnce application by setting the `fileName` parameter to the location (for example, a Web address) from which you originally installed the application. Do not start a ClickOnce application by specifying its installed location on your hard drive.  \n  \n Starting a process by specifying its file name is similar to typing the information in the `Run` dialog box of the Windows `Start` menu. Therefore, the file name does not need to represent an executable file. It can be of any file type for which the extension has been associated with an application installed on the system. For example the file name can have a .txt extension if you have associated text files with an editor, such as Notepad, or it can have a .doc if you have associated.doc files with a word processing tool, such as Microsoft Word. Similarly, in the same way that the `Run` dialog box can accept an executable file name with or without the .exe extension, the .exe extension is optional in the `fileName` parameter. For example, you can set the `fileName` parameter to either \"Notepad.exe\" or \"Notepad\".  \n  \n This overload does not allow command-line arguments for the process. If you need to specify one or more command-line arguments for the process, use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%28System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo%29?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%28System.String%2CSystem.String%29?displayProperty=fullName> overloads.  \n  \n Unlike the other overloads, the overload of <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> that has no parameters is not a `static` member. Use that overload when you have already created a <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> instance, specified start information (including the file name), and want to start a process resource and associate it with the existing <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> instance. Use one of the `static` overloads when you want to create a new <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> component rather than start a process for an existing component. Both this overload and the overload that has no parameters allow you to specify the file name of the process resource to start.  \n  \n If you have a path variable declared in your system using quotes, you must fully qualify that path when starting any process found in that location. Otherwise, the system will not find the path. For example, if `c:\\mypath` is not in your path, and you add it using quotation marks: `path = %path%;\"c:\\mypath\"`, you must fully qualify any process in `c:\\mypath` when starting it.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  ASP.NET Web page and server control code executes in the context of the ASP.NET worker process on the Web server.  If you use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> method in an ASP.NET Web page or server control, the new process executes on the Web server with restricted permissions. The process does not start in the same context as the client browser, and does not have access to the user desktop.  \n  \n Whenever you use <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> to start a process, you might need to close it or you risk losing system resources. Close processes using <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.CloseMainWindow%2A> or <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Kill%2A>. You can check whether a process has already been closed by using its <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.HasExited%2A> property.  \n  \n A note about apartment states in managed threads is necessary here. When <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.UseShellExecute%2A> is `true` on the process component's <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StartInfo%2A> property, make sure you have set a threading model on your application by setting the attribute `[STAThread]` on the `main()` method. Otherwise, a managed thread can be in an `unknown` state or put in the `MTA` state, the latter of which conflicts with <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.UseShellExecute%2A> being `true`. Some methods require that the apartment state not be `unknown`. If the state is not explicitly set, when the application encounters such a method, it defaults to `MTA`, and once set, the apartment state cannot be changed. However, `MTA` causes an exception to be thrown when the operating system shell is managing the thread.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,164],"content":"Use this overload to start a process resource by specifying its file name.

For example the file name can have a .txt extension if you have associated text files with an editor, such as Notepad, or it can have a .doc if you have associated.doc files with a word processing tool, such as Microsoft Word. Similarly, in the same way that the `Run` dialog box can accept an executable file name with or without the .exe extension, the .exe extension is optional in the `fileName` parameter. For example, you can set the `fileName` parameter to either \"Notepad.exe\" or \"Notepad\". If the `fileName` parameter represents an executable file, the `arguments` parameter might represent a file to act upon, such as the text file in `Notepad.exe myfile.txt`. If the `fileName` parameter represents a command (.cmd) file, the `arguments` parameter must include either a \"`/c`\" or \"`/k`\" argument to specify whether the command window exits or remains after completion.  \n  \n Unlike the other overloads, the overload of <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> that has no parameters is not a `static` member. Use that overload when you have already created a <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> instance, specified start information (including the file name), and want to start a process resource and associate it with the existing <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> instance. Use one of the `static` overloads when you want to create a new <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> component rather than start a process for an existing component. Both this overload and the overload that has no parameters allow you to specify the file name of the process resource to start and command-line arguments to pass.  \n  \n If you have a path variable declared in your system using quotes, you must fully qualify that path when starting any process found in that location. Otherwise, the system will not find the path. For example, if `c:\\mypath` is not in your path, and you add it using quotation marks: `path = %path%;\"c:\\mypath\"`, you must fully qualify any process in `c:\\mypath` when starting it.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  ASP.NET Web page and server control code executes in the context of the ASP.NET worker process on the Web server.  If you use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> method in an ASP.NET Web page or server control, the new process executes on the Web server with restricted permissions. The process does not start in the same context as the client browser, and does not have access to the user desktop.  \n  \n Whenever you use <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> to start a process, you might need to close it or you risk losing system resources. Close processes using <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.CloseMainWindow%2A> or <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Kill%2A>. You can check whether a process has already been closed by using its <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.HasExited%2A> property..  \n  \n A note about apartment states in managed threads is necessary here. When <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.UseShellExecute%2A> is `true` on the process component's <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StartInfo%2A> property, make sure you have set a threading model on your application by setting the attribute `[STAThread]` on the `main()` method. Otherwise, a managed thread can be in an `unknown` state or put in the `MTA` state, the latter of which conflicts with <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.UseShellExecute%2A> being `true`. Some methods require that the apartment state not be `unknown`. If the state is not explicitly set, when the application encounters such a method, it defaults to `MTA`, and once set, the apartment state cannot be changed. However, `MTA` causes an exception to be thrown when the operating system shell is managing the thread.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,191],"content":"Use this overload to start a process resource by specifying its file name and command-line arguments.

Starting a process by specifying the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> property is similar to typing the information in the **Run** dialog box of the Windows **Start** menu.

You can browse through the source code online, download the reference for offline viewing, and step through the sources (including patches and updates) during debugging; see [instructions](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/).  \\n  \\n A <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> component provides access to a process that is running on a computer. A process, in the simplest terms, is a running app. A thread is the basic unit to which the operating system allocates processor time. A thread can execute any part of the code of the process, including parts currently being executed by another thread.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> component is a useful tool for starting, stopping, controlling, and monitoring apps. You can use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> component, to obtain a list of the processes that are running, or you can start a new process. A <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> component is used to access system processes. After a <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> component has been initialized, it can be used to obtain information about the running process. Such information includes the set of threads, the loaded modules (.dll and .exe files), and performance information such as the amount of memory the process is using.  \\n  \\n This type implements the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface. When you have finished using the type, you should dispose of it either directly or indirectly. To dispose of the type directly, call its <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method in a `try`/`catch` block. To dispose of it indirectly, use a language construct such as `using` (in C#) or `Using` (in Visual Basic). For more information, see the \\\"Using an Object that Implements IDisposable\\\" section in the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface topic.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  32-bit processes cannot access the modules of a 64-bit process. If you try to get information about a 64-bit process from a 32-bit process, you will get a <xref:System.ComponentModel.Win32Exception> exception. A 64-bit process, on the other hand, can access the modules of a 32-bit process.  \\n  \\n The process component obtains information about a group of properties all at once. After the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> component has obtained information about one member of any group, it will cache the values for the other properties in that group and not obtain new information about the other members of the group until you call the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Refresh%2A> method. Therefore, a property value is not guaranteed to be any newer than the last call to the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Refresh%2A> method. The group breakdowns are operating-system dependent.  \\n  \\n If you have a path variable declared in your system using quotes, you must fully qualify that path when starting any process found in that location. Otherwise, the system will not find the path. For example, if `c:\\\\mypath` is not in your path, and you add it using quotation marks: `path = %path%;\\\"c:\\\\mypath\\\"`, you must fully qualify any process in `c:\\\\mypath` when starting it.  \\n  \\n A system process is uniquely identified on the system by its process identifier. Like many Windows resources, a process is also identified by its handle, which might not be unique on the computer. A handle is the generic term for an identifier of a resource. The operating system persists the process handle, which is accessed through the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Handle%2A> property of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> component, even when the process has exited. Thus, you can get the process's administrative information, such as the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.ExitCode%2A> (usually either zero for success or a nonzero error code) and the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.ExitTime%2A>. Handles are an extremely valuable resource, so leaking handles is more virulent than leaking memory.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  This class contains a link demand and an inheritance demand at the class level that applies to all members. A <xref:System.Security.SecurityException> is thrown when either the immediate caller or the derived class does not have full-trust permission. For details about security demands, see [Link Demands](~/docs/framework/misc/link-demands.md).  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"Core\\\"></a>   \\n## [!INCLUDE[net_core](~/includes/net-core-md.md)] Notes  \\n In the .NET Framework on the desktop, the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> class by default uses <xref:System.Console> encodings, which are typically code page encodings, for the input, output, and error streams. For example code, on systems whose culture is English (United States), code page 437 is the default encoding for the <xref:System.Console> class. However, [!INCLUDE[net_core](~/includes/net-core-md.md)] may make only a limited subset of these encodings available. If this is the case, it uses <xref:System.Text.Encoding.UTF8%2A?displayProperty=fullName> as the default encoding.  \\n  \\n If a <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> object depends on specific code page encodings, you can still make them available by doing the following *before* you call any <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> methods:  \\n  \\n1.  Add a reference to the System.Text.Encoding.CodePages.dll assembly to your project.  \\n  \\n2.

The <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.EnableRaisingEvents%2A> property is used in asynchronous processing to notify your application that a process has exited. To force your application to synchronously wait for an exit event (which interrupts processing of the application until the exit event has occurred), use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.WaitForExit%2A> method.\n\n\n    > [!NOTE]\n\n    > If you're using Visual Studio and double-click a <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> component in your project, an <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Exited> event delegate and event handler are automatically generated. Additional code sets the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.EnableRaisingEvents%2A> property to `false`. You must change this property to `true` for your event handler to execute when the associated process exits.\n\n\n    If the component's <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.EnableRaisingEvents%2A> value is `true`, or when <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.EnableRaisingEvents%2A> is `false` and a <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.HasExited%2A> check is invoked by the component, the component can access the administrative information for the associated process, which remains stored by the operating system. Such information includes the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.ExitTime%2A> and the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.ExitCode%2A>.\n\n\n    After the associated process exits, the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Handle%2A> of the component no longer points to an existing process resource. Instead, it can only be used to access the operating system's information about the process resource. The operating system is aware that there are handles to exited processes that haven't been released by <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> components, so it keeps the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.ExitTime%2A> and <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Handle%2A> information in memory.\n\n\n    There's a cost associated with watching for a process to exit. If <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.EnableRaisingEvents%2A> is `true`, the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Exited> event is raised when the associated process terminates. Your procedures for the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Exited> event run at that time.\n\n\n    Sometimes, your application starts a process but doesn't require notification of its closure. For example, your application can start Notepad to allow the user to perform text editing but make no further use of the Notepad application. You can choose to avoid notification when the process exits because it's not relevant to the continued operation of your application.

Otherwise, reading from the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardError%2A> stream throws an exception.  \\n  \\n The redirected <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardError%2A> stream can be read synchronously or asynchronously. Methods such as <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.Read%2A>, <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.ReadLine%2A>, and <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.ReadToEnd%2A> perform synchronous read operations on the error output stream of the process.

This method enables a designated event handler for the stream output and immediately returns to the caller, which can perform other work while the stream output is directed to the event handler.  \\n  \\n Synchronous read operations introduce a dependency between the caller reading from the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardError%2A> stream and the child process writing to that stream. These dependencies can result in deadlock conditions. When the caller reads from the redirected stream of a child process, it is dependent on the child. The caller waits on the read operation until the child writes to the stream or closes the stream. When the child process writes enough data to fill its redirected stream, it is dependent on the parent. The child process waits on the next write operation until the parent reads from the full stream or closes the stream. The deadlock condition results when the caller and child process wait on each other to complete an operation, and neither can proceed. You can avoid deadlocks by evaluating dependencies between the caller and child process.  \\n  \\n The following C# code, for example, shows how to read from a redirected stream and wait for the child process to exit.  \\n  \\n```  \\n// Start the child process.  \\n Process p = new Process();  \\n // Redirect the error stream of the child process.  \\n p.StartInfo.UseShellExecute = false;  \\n p.StartInfo.RedirectStandardError = true;  \\n p.StartInfo.FileName = \\\"Write500Lines.exe\\\";  \\n p.Start();  \\n // Do not wait for the child process to exit before  \\n // reading to the end of its redirected error stream.  \\n // p.WaitForExit();  \\n // Read the error stream first and then wait.  \\n string error = p.StandardError.ReadToEnd();  \\n p.WaitForExit();  \\n```  \\n  \\n The code example avoids a deadlock condition by calling `p.StandardError.ReadToEnd` before `p.WaitForExit`. A deadlock condition can result if the parent process calls `p.WaitForExit` before `p.StandardError.ReadToEnd` and the child process writes enough text to fill the redirected stream. The parent process would wait indefinitely for the child process to exit. The child process would wait indefinitely for the parent to read from the full <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardError%2A> stream.  \\n  \\n There is a similar issue when you read all text from both the standard output and standard error streams. The following C# code, for example, performs a read operation on both streams.  \\n  \\n```  \\n// Do not perform a synchronous read to the end of both   \\n// redirected streams.  \\n// string output = p.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd();  \\n// string error = p.StandardError.ReadToEnd();  \\n// p.WaitForExit();  \\n// Use asynchronous read operations on at least one of the streams.  \\np.BeginOutputReadLine();  \\nstring error = p.StandardError.ReadToEnd();  \\np.WaitForExit();  \\n```  \\n  \\n The code example avoids the deadlock condition by performing asynchronous read operations on the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardOutput%2A> stream. A deadlock condition results if the parent process calls `p.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd` followed by `p.StandardError.ReadToEnd` and the child process writes enough text to fill its error stream. The parent process would wait indefinitely for the child process to close its <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardOutput%2A> stream. The child process would wait indefinitely for the parent to read from the full <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StandardError%2A> stream.  \\n  \\n You can use asynchronous read operations to avoid these dependencies and their deadlock potential. Alternately, you can avoid the deadlock condition by creating two threads and reading the output of each stream on a separate thread.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  You cannot mix asynchronous and synchronous read operations on a redirected stream. Once the redirected stream of a <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> is opened in either asynchronous or synchronous mode, all further read operations on that stream must be in the same mode.

Instead, the running process resource is reused and `false` is returned.  \\n  \\n You can start a ClickOnce application by specifying the location (for example, a Web address) from which you originally installed the application. Do not start a ClickOnce application by specifying its installed location on your hard drive.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  If you are using Visual Studio, this overload of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> method is the one that you insert into your code after you drag a <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> component onto the designer. Use the `Properties` window to expand the `StartInfo` category and write the appropriate value into the `FileName` property. Your changes will appear in the form's `InitializeComponent` procedure.  \\n  \\n This overload of <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> is not a `static` method. You must call it from an instance of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> class. Before calling <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A>, you must first specify <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StartInfo%2A> property information for this <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> instance, because that information is used to determine the process resource to start.  \\n  \\n The other overloads of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> method are `static` members. You do not need to create an instance of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> component before you call those overloads of the method. Instead, you can call <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> for the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> class itself, and a new <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> component is created if the process was started. Or, `null` is returned if a process was reused. The process resource is automatically associated with the new <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> component that is returned by the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> method.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StartInfo%2A> members can be used to duplicate the functionality of the `Run` dialog box of the Windows `Start` menu. Anything that can be typed into a command line can be started by setting the appropriate values in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StartInfo%2A> property. The only <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StartInfo%2A> property that must be set is the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> property. The <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> property does not have to be an executable file. It can be of any file type for which the extension has been associated with an application that is installed on the system. For example, the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> property can have a .txt extension if you have associated text files with an editor, such as Notepad, or it can have a .doc extension if you have associated.doc files with a word processing tool, such as Microsoft Word.  \\n  \\n In the command line, you can specify actions to take for certain types of files. For example, you can print documents or edit text files. Specify these actions using the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.Verb%2A> member of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StartInfo%2A> property. For other types of files, you can specify command-line arguments when you start the file from the `Run` dialog box. For example, you can pass a URL as an argument if you specify your browser as the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A>. These arguments can be specified in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StartInfo%2A> property's <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.Arguments%2A> member.  \\n  \\n If you have a path variable declared in your system using quotes, you must fully qualify that path when starting any process found in that location. Otherwise, the system will not find the path. For example, if `c:\\\\mypath` is not in your path, and you add it using quotation marks: `path = %path%;\\\"c:\\\\mypath\\\"`, you must fully qualify any process in `c:\\\\mypath` when starting it.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  ASP.NET Web page and server control code executes in the context of the ASP.NET worker process on the Web server.  If you use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> method in an ASP.NET Web page or server control, the new process executes on the Web server with restricted permissions. The process does not start in the same context as the client browser, and does not have access to the user desktop.  \\n  \\n Whenever you use <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> to start a process, you might need to close it or you risk losing system resources. Close processes using <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.CloseMainWindow%2A> or <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Kill%2A>. You can check whether a process has already been closed by using its <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.HasExited%2A> property.  \\n  \\n A note about apartment states in managed threads is necessary here. When <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.UseShellExecute%2A> is `true` on the process component's <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StartInfo%2A> property, make sure you have set a threading model on your application by setting the attribute `[STAThread]` on the `main()` method. Otherwise, a managed thread can be in an `unknown` state or put in the `MTA` state, the latter of which conflicts with <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.UseShellExecute%2A> being `true`. Some methods require that the apartment state not be `unknown`. If the state is not explicitly set, when the application encounters such a method, it defaults to `MTA`, and once set, the apartment state cannot be changed.

The overload associates the resource with a new <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> object.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  If the address of the executable file to start is a URL, the process is not started and `null` is returned.  \\n  \\n This overload lets you start a process without first creating a new <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> instance. The overload is an alternative to the explicit steps of creating a new <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> instance, setting the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> and <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.Arguments%2A> members of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StartInfo%2A> property, and calling <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> for the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> instance.  \\n  \\n Starting a process by specifying its file name and arguments is similar to typing the file name and command-line arguments in the `Run` dialog box of the Windows `Start` menu. Therefore, the file name does not need to represent an executable file. It can be of any file type for which the extension has been associated with an application installed on the system. For example the file name can have a .txt extension if you have associated text files with an editor, such as Notepad, or it can have a .doc if you have associated.doc files with a word processing tool, such as Microsoft Word. Similarly, in the same way that the `Run` dialog box can accept an executable file name with or without the .exe extension, the .exe extension is optional in the `fileName` parameter. For example, you can set the `fileName` parameter to either \\\"Notepad.exe\\\" or \\\"Notepad\\\". If the `fileName` parameter represents an executable file, the `arguments` parameter might represent a file to act upon, such as the text file in `Notepad.exe myfile.txt`. If the `fileName` parameter represents a command (.cmd) file, the `arguments` parameter must include either a \\\"`/c`\\\" or \\\"`/k`\\\" argument to specify whether the command window exits or remains after completion.  \\n  \\n Unlike the other overloads, the overload of <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> that has no parameters is not a `static` member. Use that overload when you have already created a <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> instance, specified start information (including the file name), and want to start a process resource and associate it with the existing <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> instance. Use one of the `static` overloads when you want to create a new <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> component rather than start a process for an existing component. Both this overload and the overload that has no parameters allow you to specify the file name of the process resource to start and command-line arguments to pass.  \\n  \\n If you have a path variable declared in your system using quotes, you must fully qualify that path when starting any process found in that location. Otherwise, the system will not find the path. For example, if `c:\\\\mypath` is not in your path, and you add it using quotation marks: `path = %path%;\\\"c:\\\\mypath\\\"`, you must fully qualify any process in `c:\\\\mypath` when starting it.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  ASP.NET Web page and server control code executes in the context of the ASP.NET worker process on the Web server.  If you use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> method in an ASP.NET Web page or server control, the new process executes on the Web server with restricted permissions. The process does not start in the same context as the client browser, and does not have access to the user desktop.  \\n  \\n Whenever you use <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> to start a process, you might need to close it or you risk losing system resources. Close processes using <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.CloseMainWindow%2A> or <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Kill%2A>. You can check whether a process has already been closed by using its <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.HasExited%2A> property..  \\n  \\n A note about apartment states in managed threads is necessary here. When <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.UseShellExecute%2A> is `true` on the process component's <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StartInfo%2A> property, make sure you have set a threading model on your application by setting the attribute `[STAThread]` on the `main()` method. Otherwise, a managed thread can be in an `unknown` state or put in the `MTA` state, the latter of which conflicts with <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.UseShellExecute%2A> being `true`. Some methods require that the apartment state not be `unknown`. If the state is not explicitly set, when the application encounters such a method, it defaults to `MTA`, and once set, the apartment state cannot be changed. However, `MTA` causes an exception to be thrown when the operating system shell is managing the thread.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following example first spawns an instance of Internet Explorer and displays the contents of the Favorites folder in the browser.

If you call the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%28System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo%29> method with the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.UserName%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.Password%2A?displayProperty=fullName> properties set, the unmanaged `CreateProcessWithLogonW` function is called, which starts the process in a new window even if the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.CreateNoWindow%2A> property value is `true` or the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.WindowStyle%2A> property value is <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessWindowStyle.Hidden>.  \\n  \\n If you did not use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> method to start a process, the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StartInfo%2A> property does not reflect the parameters used to start the process. For example, if you use <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.GetProcesses%2A> to get an array of processes running on the computer, the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StartInfo%2A> property of each <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> does not contain the original file name or arguments used to start the process.  \\n  \\n When the process is started, the file name is the file that populates the (read-only) <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.MainModule%2A> property. If you want to retrieve the executable file that is associated with the process after the process has started, use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.MainModule%2A> property. If you want to set the executable file of a <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process> instance for which an associated process has not been started, use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StartInfo%2A> property's <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> member. Because the members of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StartInfo%2A> property are arguments that are passed to the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.Start%2A> method of a process, changing the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo.FileName%2A> property after the associated process has started will not reset the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.MainModule%2A> property. These properties are used only to initialize the associated process.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following example populates a <xref:System.Diagnostics.Process.StartInfo%2A> with the file to execute, the action performed on it and whether it should displays a user interface.
