To form a connection, the two controls must reside in a zone that inherits from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> class (such as the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> control), and they must be designed correctly to share data through a common interface. For details about Web Parts connections, see <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnection> and [Web Parts Connections Overview](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/d98cfd0f-ebd6-4871-89d5-abbd2cdef67b).  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnectionsEventArgs> class passes event data to methods that use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnectionsEventHandler> delegate to handle events. There are two such connection-related methods that raise events and use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnectionsEventArgs> class to provide event data. Both are members of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.OnWebPartsConnected%2A> method raises the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsConnected> event after two server controls have successfully connected, and the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.OnWebPartsDisconnected%2A> method raises the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsDisconnected> event after two server controls have been disconnected.  \\n  \\n Developers can create custom event handler methods for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsConnected> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsDisconnected> events, and in those methods, they can use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnectionsEventArgs> class to access details of a connection. For example, a developer can declare the `OnWebPartsConnected` attribute on the `<asp:webpartmanager>` element, and assign to it a custom method name that will handle the event. In the custom handler method, developers can access the details of a connection by using the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnectionsEventArgs> object that is passed to the method as a parameter.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnectionsEventArgs> class has two overloads of the constructor. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnectionsEventArgs.%23ctor%28System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart%2CSystem.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ProviderConnectionPoint%2CSystem.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart%2CSystem.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConsumerConnectionPoint%29?displayProperty=fullName> constructor is the default; it initializes the property values for the class. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnectionsEventArgs.%23ctor%28System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart%2CSystem.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ProviderConnectionPoint%2CSystem.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart%2CSystem.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConsumerConnectionPoint%2CSystem.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnection%29?displayProperty=fullName> constructor calls the default constructor, and then it also initializes the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnectionsEventArgs.Connection%2A> property.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnectionsEventArgs> class has several properties, all of which refer to the essential aspects of a Web Parts connection. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnectionsEventArgs.Connection%2A> property refers to the associated <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnection> object that represents the entire connection. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnectionsEventArgs.Provider%2A> property references a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> or other server control acting as the provider in the connection, and the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnectionsEventArgs.Consumer%2A> property references a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> or server control acting as the consumer.
