The <xref:System.Web.Management> namespace contains the health event types responsible for packaging application health-status data and the provider types responsible for processing this data. It also contains supporting types that help during the management of health events.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Web.Management.WebSuccessAuditEvent> class is used when a successful security-related operation occurs. An example of this is a successful URL authorization for a Web request.  \\n  \\n The following list describes the features for which events of type <xref:System.Web.Management.WebSuccessAuditEvent> are raised by ASP.NET:  \\n  \\n-   File Authorization. Successful conditions are audited. File authorization is only attempted by ASP.NET when a Windows Identity is associated with the request. The related event audit code is <xref:System.Web.Management.WebEventCodes.AuditFileAuthorizationSuccess>.  \\n  \\n-   URL Authorization. It signifies access of a URL resource for which authorization is granted. Successful conditions are audited. The related event audit code is <xref:System.Web.Management.WebEventCodes.AuditUrlAuthorizationSuccess>.  \\n  \\n-   Other security conditions. The following is a list of the related event codes:  \\n  \\n    -   <xref:System.Web.Management.WebEventCodes.AuditFormsAuthenticationSuccess>  \\n  \\n    -   <xref:System.Web.Management.WebEventCodes.AuditMembershipAuthenticationSuccess>  \\n  \\n When a <xref:System.Web.Management.WebSuccessAuditEvent> is raised, ASP.NET health monitoring increments the related Audit Success Events Raised performance counter and then checks the `healthMonitoring` configuration to determine whether any providers subscribe to the event. If providers subscribe to the event, ASP.NET dispatches the event to them for processing.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  To view the Audit Success Event Raised performance counter in System Monitor (PerfMon), in the **Add Counters** window select **ASP.NET** from the **Performance object** drop-down list, select the **Audit Success Event Raised** performance counter, and click the **Add** button. For more information, see [Monitoring ASP.NET Application Performance](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/c96da1d1-6077-48d3-88e2-d9127ed91cf5).  \\n  \\n Because success audits represent an expected condition, you may not want to subscribe to them. You can subscribe to them in order to provide access auditing for the site.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  In most cases you will be able to use the ASP.NET health-monitoring types as implemented, and you will control the health-monitoring system by specifying values in the `healthMonitoring` configuration section. You can also derive from the health-monitoring types to create your own custom events and providers.
