You can browse through the source code online, download the reference for offline viewing, and step through the sources (including patches and updates) during debugging; see [instructions](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/).  \n  \n Each element is a key/value pair stored in a <xref:System.Collections.DictionaryEntry> object. A key cannot be `null`, but a value can be.  \n  \n The objects used as keys by a <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable> are required to override the <xref:System.Object.GetHashCode%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method (or the <xref:System.Collections.IHashCodeProvider> interface) and the <xref:System.Object.Equals%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method (or the <xref:System.Collections.IComparer> interface). The implementation of both methods and interfaces must handle case sensitivity the same way; otherwise, the <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable> might behave incorrectly. For example, when creating a <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable>, you must use the <xref:System.Collections.CaseInsensitiveHashCodeProvider> class (or any case-insensitive <xref:System.Collections.IHashCodeProvider> implementation) with the <xref:System.Collections.CaseInsensitiveComparer> class (or any case-insensitive <xref:System.Collections.IComparer> implementation).  \n  \n Furthermore, these methods must produce the same results when called with the same parameters while the key exists in the <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable>. An alternative is to use a <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable> constructor with an <xref:System.Collections.IEqualityComparer> parameter. If key equality were simply reference equality, the inherited implementation of <xref:System.Object.GetHashCode%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Object.Equals%2A?displayProperty=fullName> would suffice.  \n  \n Key objects must be immutable as long as they are used as keys in the <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable>.  \n  \n When an element is added to the <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable>, the element is placed into a bucket based on the hash code of the key. Subsequent lookups of the key use the hash code of the key to search in only one particular bucket, thus substantially reducing the number of key comparisons required to find an element.  \n  \n The load factor of a <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable> determines the maximum ratio of elements to buckets. Smaller load factors cause faster average lookup times at the cost of increased memory consumption. The default load factor of 1.0 generally provides the best balance between speed and size. A different load factor can also be specified when the <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable> is created.  \n  \n As elements are added to a <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable>, the actual load factor of the <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable> increases. When the actual load factor reaches the specified load factor, the number of buckets in the <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable> is automatically increased to the smallest prime number that is larger than twice the current number of <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable> buckets.  \n  \n Each key object in the <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable> must provide its own hash function, which can be accessed by calling <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable.GetHash%2A>. However, any object implementing <xref:System.Collections.IHashCodeProvider> can be passed to a <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable> constructor, and that hash function is used for all objects in the table.  \n  \n The capacity of a <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable> is the number of elements the <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable> can hold. As elements are added to a <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable>, the capacity is automatically increased as required through reallocation.  \n  \n For very large <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable> objects, you can increase the maximum capacity to 2 billion elements on a 64-bit system by setting the `enabled` attribute of the  configuration element to `true` in the run-time environment.  \n  \n The `foreach` statement of the C# language (`For Each` in Visual Basic) returns an object of the type of the elements in the collection. Since each element of the <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable> is a key/value pair, the element type is not the type of the key or the type of the value. Instead, the element type is <xref:System.Collections.DictionaryEntry>. For example:  \n  \n [!code-cpp[System.Collections.Hashtable_ClassExample#01](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.Collections.Hashtable_ClassExample/cpp/remarks.cpp#01)]\n [!code-csharp[System.Collections.Hashtable_ClassExample#01](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.Collections.Hashtable_ClassExample/cs/remarks.cs#01)]\n [!code-vb[System.Collections.Hashtable_ClassExample#01](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.Collections.Hashtable_ClassExample/vb/remarks.vb#01)]  \n  \n The `foreach` statement is a wrapper around the enumerator, which only allows reading from, not writing to, the collection.  \n  \n Because serializing and deserializing an enumerator for a <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable> can cause the elements to become reordered, it is not possible to continue enumeration without calling the <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Reset%2A> method.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Because keys can be inherited and their behavior changed, their absolute uniqueness cannot be guaranteed by comparisons using the <xref:System.Type.Equals%2A> method.","nodes":[{"pos":[2,420],"content":"[!NOTE]\n To view the .NET Framework source code for this type, see the [Reference Source](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/collections/hashtable.cs#10fefb6e0ae510dd).

You can browse through the source code online, download the reference for offline viewing, and step through the sources (including patches and updates) during debugging; see [instructions](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/).  \\n  \\n Each element is a key/value pair stored in a <xref:System.Collections.DictionaryEntry> object. A key cannot be `null`, but a value can be.  \\n  \\n The objects used as keys by a <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable> are required to override the <xref:System.Object.GetHashCode%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method (or the <xref:System.Collections.IHashCodeProvider> interface) and the <xref:System.Object.Equals%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method (or the <xref:System.Collections.IComparer> interface). The implementation of both methods and interfaces must handle case sensitivity the same way; otherwise, the <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable> might behave incorrectly. For example, when creating a <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable>, you must use the <xref:System.Collections.CaseInsensitiveHashCodeProvider> class (or any case-insensitive <xref:System.Collections.IHashCodeProvider> implementation) with the <xref:System.Collections.CaseInsensitiveComparer> class (or any case-insensitive <xref:System.Collections.IComparer> implementation).  \\n  \\n Furthermore, these methods must produce the same results when called with the same parameters while the key exists in the <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable>. An alternative is to use a <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable> constructor with an <xref:System.Collections.IEqualityComparer> parameter. If key equality were simply reference equality, the inherited implementation of <xref:System.Object.GetHashCode%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Object.Equals%2A?displayProperty=fullName> would suffice.  \\n  \\n Key objects must be immutable as long as they are used as keys in the <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable>.  \\n  \\n When an element is added to the <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable>, the element is placed into a bucket based on the hash code of the key. Subsequent lookups of the key use the hash code of the key to search in only one particular bucket, thus substantially reducing the number of key comparisons required to find an element.  \\n  \\n The load factor of a <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable> determines the maximum ratio of elements to buckets. Smaller load factors cause faster average lookup times at the cost of increased memory consumption. The default load factor of 1.0 generally provides the best balance between speed and size. A different load factor can also be specified when the <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable> is created.  \\n  \\n As elements are added to a <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable>, the actual load factor of the <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable> increases. When the actual load factor reaches the specified load factor, the number of buckets in the <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable> is automatically increased to the smallest prime number that is larger than twice the current number of <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable> buckets.  \\n  \\n Each key object in the <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable> must provide its own hash function, which can be accessed by calling <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable.GetHash%2A>. However, any object implementing <xref:System.Collections.IHashCodeProvider> can be passed to a <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable> constructor, and that hash function is used for all objects in the table.  \\n  \\n The capacity of a <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable> is the number of elements the <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable> can hold. As elements are added to a <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable>, the capacity is automatically increased as required through reallocation.  \\n  \\n For very large <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable> objects, you can increase the maximum capacity to 2 billion elements on a 64-bit system by setting the `enabled` attribute of the  configuration element to `true` in the run-time environment.  \\n  \\n The `foreach` statement of the C# language (`For Each` in Visual Basic) returns an object of the type of the elements in the collection. Since each element of the <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable> is a key/value pair, the element type is not the type of the key or the type of the value. Instead, the element type is <xref:System.Collections.DictionaryEntry>.

Therefore, using `foreach` is recommended, instead of directly manipulating the enumerator.  \\n  \\n Enumerators can be used to read the data in the collection, but they cannot be used to modify the underlying collection.  \\n  \\n Initially, the enumerator is positioned before the first element in the collection. <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Reset%2A> also brings the enumerator back to this position.  At this position, <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Current%2A> is undefined. Therefore, you must call <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> to advance the enumerator to the first element of the collection before reading the value of <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Current%2A>.  \\n  \\n <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Current%2A> returns the same object until either <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> or <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Reset%2A> is called. <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> sets <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Current%2A> to the next element.  \\n  \\n If <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> passes the end of the collection, the enumerator is positioned after the last element in the collection and <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> returns `false`. When the enumerator is at this position, subsequent calls to <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> also return `false`. If the last call to <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> returned `false`, <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Current%2A> is undefined. To set <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Current%2A> to the first element of the collection again, you can call <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Reset%2A> followed by <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A>.  \\n  \\n An enumerator remains valid as long as the collection remains unchanged. If changes are made to the collection, such as adding, modifying, or deleting elements, the enumerator is irrecoverably invalidated and its behavior is undefined.  \\n  \\n The enumerator does not have exclusive access to the collection; therefore, enumerating through a collection is intrinsically not a thread safe procedure.  To guarantee thread safety during enumeration, you can lock the collection during the entire enumeration.  To allow the collection to be accessed by multiple threads for reading and writing, you must implement your own synchronization.  \\n  \\n This method is an O(1) operation.  \\n  \\n Because serializing and deserializing an enumerator for a <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable> can cause the elements to become reordered, it is not possible to continue enumeration without calling the <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Reset%2A> method.\"\n  example:\n  -

Therefore, using `foreach` is recommended, instead of directly manipulating the enumerator.  \\n  \\n Enumerators can be used to read the data in the collection, but they cannot be used to modify the underlying collection.  \\n  \\n Initially, the enumerator is positioned before the first element in the collection. <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Reset%2A> also brings the enumerator back to this position. At this position, calling <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Current%2A> throws an exception. Therefore, you must call <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> to advance the enumerator to the first element of the collection before reading the value of <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Current%2A>.  \\n  \\n <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Current%2A> returns the same object until either <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> or <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Reset%2A> is called. <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> sets <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Current%2A> to the next element.  \\n  \\n If <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> passes the end of the collection, the enumerator is positioned after the last element in the collection and <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> returns `false`. When the enumerator is at this position, subsequent calls to <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> also return `false`. If the last call to <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> returned `false`, calling <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Current%2A> throws an exception. To set <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Current%2A> to the first element of the collection again, you can call <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Reset%2A> followed by <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A>.  \\n  \\n An enumerator remains valid as long as the collection remains unchanged. If changes are made to the collection, such as adding, modifying, or deleting elements, the enumerator can be invalidated and the next call to <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> or <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Reset%2A> throws an <xref:System.InvalidOperationException>.
