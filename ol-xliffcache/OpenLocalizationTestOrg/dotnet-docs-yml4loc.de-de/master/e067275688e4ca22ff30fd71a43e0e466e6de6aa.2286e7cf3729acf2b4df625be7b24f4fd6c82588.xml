When the user switches back to Source view, the design-time control is persisted to markup source code and edited into the markup for the Web page. The <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.WebControls.HierarchicalDataBoundControlDesigner> class provides design-time support for controls that are derived from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.HierarchicalDataBoundControl> in a designer host.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.WebControls.HierarchicalDataBoundControlDesigner> class properties provide the following functionality:  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.WebControls.HierarchicalDataBoundControlDesigner.ActionLists%2A> property returns a <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionListCollection> object, which typically contains an object that is derived from the <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionList> class for each level in the inheritance tree of the designer.  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.WebControls.HierarchicalDataBoundControlDesigner.DataSourceDesigner%2A> property provides access to the designer of the data source, if one is defined.  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.WebControls.HierarchicalDataBoundControlDesigner.DesignerView%2A> property gets the default view of the data source that is bound to the associated control.  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.WebControls.HierarchicalDataBoundControlDesigner.UseDataSourcePickerActionList%2A> property determines whether the control should render its default action lists for choosing and creating data sources.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.WebControls.HierarchicalDataBoundControlDesigner> class methods provide the following functionality:  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.WebControls.HierarchicalDataBoundControlDesigner.ConnectToDataSource%2A> method performs the actions that are necessary to connect to the current data source.  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.WebControls.HierarchicalDataBoundControlDesigner.CreateDataSource%2A> method creates a new data source for the associated control.  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.WebControls.HierarchicalDataBoundControlDesigner.DataBind%2A> method binds the associated control that is derived from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.HierarchicalDataBoundControl> class to a design-time data source.  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.WebControls.HierarchicalDataBoundControlDesigner.DisconnectFromDataSource%2A> method performs the actions that are necessary to disconnect from the current data source.  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.WebControls.HierarchicalDataBoundControlDesigner.GetDesignTimeDataSource%2A> method gets a data source that can be used at design time for the associated control.  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.WebControls.HierarchicalDataBoundControlDesigner.GetSampleDataSource%2A> method constructs a sample data source that can be used at design time for the associated control.  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.WebControls.HierarchicalDataBoundControlDesigner.PreFilterProperties%2A> method is used to remove properties from or add additional properties to or to shadow properties of the associated control that is derived from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.HierarchicalDataBoundControl> class.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example shows how to extend the <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.WebControls.HierarchicalDataBoundControlDesigner> class to change the appearance of controls that are derived from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.HierarchicalDataBoundControl> control at design time.  \\n  \\n The example derives the `MyHierarchicalDataBoundControl` class from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.HierarchicalDataBoundControl>. The `MyHierarchicalDataBoundControl` class is simply a copy of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.HierarchicalDataBoundControl>. The example also derives the `MyHierarchicalDataBoundControlDesigner` class from the <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.WebControls.HierarchicalDataBoundControlDesigner> class and places a <xref:System.ComponentModel.DesignerAttribute> object for the `MyHierarchicalDataBoundControlDesigner` on the `MyHierarchicalDataBoundControl` class.  \\n  \\n The `MyHierarchicalDataBoundControlDesigner` overrides the <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.WebControls.HierarchicalDataBoundControlDesigner.PreFilterProperties%2A> method to make the <xref:System.Web.UI.Control.NamingContainer%2A> property visible in the **Properties** grid at design time. It overrides the <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.WebControls.BaseDataBoundControlDesigner.GetDesignTimeHtml%2A> method to generate the markup for a placeholder if the design time markup is `null` or <xref:System.String.Empty>, or if the design-time markup is an empty `<span>` block (that is, if there is no inner markup between the `<span` …`>` and `</span>` tags).  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[System.Web.UI.Design.WebControls.HierarchicalDataBoundControlDesigner#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_WebNet/System.Web.UI.Design.WebControls.HierarchicalDataBoundControlDesigner/CS/hierarchicaldatabounddesigner.cs#1)]\\n [!code-vb[System.Web.UI.Design.WebControls.HierarchicalDataBoundControlDesigner#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_WebNet/System.Web.UI.Design.WebControls.HierarchicalDataBoundControlDesigner/VB/hierarchicaldatabounddesigner.vb#1)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: 'public class HierarchicalDataBoundControlDesigner : System.Web.UI.Design.WebControls.BaseDataBoundControlDesigner'\n  inheritance:\n  -
