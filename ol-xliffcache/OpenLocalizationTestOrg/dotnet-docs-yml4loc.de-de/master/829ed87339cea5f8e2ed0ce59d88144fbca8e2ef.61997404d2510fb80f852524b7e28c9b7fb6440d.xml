Regardless of how the data is stored in the data store (some data stores might perform some type of intelligent storage), the personalization data must be returned as a packed set of bytes in two arrays. The returned data must conform to the following rules:  \\n  \\n-   The data for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PersonalizationScope.Shared> scope must always be returned in the `sharedDataBlob` parameter.  \\n  \\n-   Depending on the key values, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PersonalizationScope.User> data is returned in the `userDataBlob` parameter. A non-`null` value for the `userName` parameter indicates that <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PersonalizationScope.User> data should also be retrieved.  \\n  \\n A personalization provider that derives from <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PersonalizationProvider> and implements this method can optimize interactions with its data store by retrieving all personalization data in one round trip, as opposed to retrieving <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PersonalizationScope.Shared> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PersonalizationScope.User> data in two separate round trips.\"\n  syntax:\n    content: protected abstract void LoadPersonalizationBlobs (System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager webPartManager, string path, string userName, ref byte[] sharedDataBlob, ref byte[] userDataBlob);\n    parameters:\n    - id: webPartManager\n      type: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager\n      description: The <xref href=\"System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager\"></xref> managing the personalization data.\n    - id: path\n      type: System.String\n      description: The path for personalization information to be used as the retrieval key.\n    - id: userName\n      type: System.String\n      description: The user name for personalization information to be used as the retrieval key.\n    - id: sharedDataBlob\n      type: System.Byte[]\n      description: The returned data for the <xref href=\"System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PersonalizationScope.Shared\"></xref> scope.\n    - id: userDataBlob\n      type: System.Byte[]\n      description: The returned data for the <xref href=\"System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PersonalizationScope.User\"></xref> scope.\n  overload: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PersonalizationProvider.LoadPersonalizationBlobs*\n  exceptions: []\n  version:\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  monikers:\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  content_git_url: https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/xml/System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts/PersonalizationProvider.xml\n  ms.technology:\n  - dotnet-webforms\n  author: tdykstra\n  ms.author: tdykstra\n  manager: wpickett\n- uid: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PersonalizationProvider.LoadPersonalizationState(System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager,System.Boolean)\n  commentId: M:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PersonalizationProvider.LoadPersonalizationState(System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager,System.Boolean)\n  id: LoadPersonalizationState(System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager,System.Boolean)\n  parent: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PersonalizationProvider\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: LoadPersonalizationState(WebPartManager, Boolean)\n  nameWithType: PersonalizationProvider.LoadPersonalizationState(WebPartManager, Boolean)\n  fullName: PersonalizationProvider.LoadPersonalizationState(WebPartManager, Boolean)\n  type: Method\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Web\n  namespace: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts\n  summary: Loads the raw data from the underlying data store and converts that data into a <xref href=\"System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PersonalizationState\"></xref> object.\n  remarks: \"This method is the main entry point used by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartPersonalization> class to load personalization data.
