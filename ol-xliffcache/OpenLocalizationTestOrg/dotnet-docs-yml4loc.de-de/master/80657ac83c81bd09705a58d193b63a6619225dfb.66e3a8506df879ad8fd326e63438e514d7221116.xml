A <xref href=\"System.Drawing.Bitmap\"></xref> is an object used to work with images defined by pixel data.\n  remarks: \"A bitmap consists of the pixel data for a graphics image and its attributes. There are many standard formats for saving a bitmap to a file. [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](~/includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] supports the following file formats: BMP, GIF, EXIF, JPG, PNG and TIFF. For more information about supported formats, see [Types of Bitmaps](~/docs/framework/winforms/advanced/types-of-bitmaps.md).  \\n  \\n You can create images from files, streams, and other sources by using one of the <xref:System.Drawing.Bitmap.%23ctor%2A> constructors and save them to a stream or to the file system with the <xref:System.Drawing.Image.Save%2A> method. Images are drawn to the screen or to memory by using the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawImage%2A> method of the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object. For a list of topics about working with image files, see [Working with Images, Bitmaps, Icons, and Metafiles](~/docs/framework/winforms/advanced/working-with-images-bitmaps-icons-and-metafiles.md).  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  The <xref:System.Drawing.Bitmap> class is not accessible across application domains. For example, if you create a dynamic <xref:System.AppDomain> and create several brushes, pens, and bitmaps in that domain, then pass these objects back to the main application domain, you can successfully use the pens and brushes. However, if you call the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawImage%2A> method to draw the marshaled <xref:System.Drawing.Bitmap>, you receive the following exception.  \\n>   \\n>  Remoting cannot find field \\\"native image\\\" on type \\\"System.Drawing.Image\\\".\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example demonstrates how to construct a new <xref:System.Drawing.Bitmap> from a file, using the <xref:System.Drawing.Bitmap.GetPixel%2A> and <xref:System.Drawing.Bitmap.SetPixel%2A> methods to recolor the image.
