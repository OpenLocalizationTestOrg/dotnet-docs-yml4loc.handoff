general difference being the addition of the <xref:System.Windows.Input.ModifierKeys.Shift> key to differentiate selection commands from caret movement commands.  For example, the <xref:System.Windows.Documents.EditingCommands.MoveLeftByCharacter%2A> command has a default key gesture of <xref:System.Windows.Input.Key.Left>, and the corresponding <xref:System.Windows.Documents.EditingCommands.SelectLeftByCharacter%2A> command has a default key gesture of <xref:System.Windows.Input.ModifierKeys.Shift>+<xref:System.Windows.Input.Key.Left>.  \\n  \\n In general, the command definitions provided by the <xref:System.Windows.Documents.EditingCommands> class do not make use of command parameters (the `parameter` parameter expected by the <xref:System.Windows.Input.ICommand.Execute%2A> method).  \\n  \\n For more information on commands and commanding, see [Input Overview](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/input-overview.md).\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following example demonstrates how to invoke an editing command on an object that supports the command.  \\n  \\n For this example, a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.RichTextBox> serves as the command target.

Most editing commands ignore the command parameter; in general, this parameter should be `null` for editing commands.  \\n  \\n The second argument specifies the object to which the command will be routed.
