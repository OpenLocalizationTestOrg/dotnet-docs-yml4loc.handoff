System.Drawing\n  namespace: System.Drawing\n  summary: Encapsulates a GDI+ drawing surface. This class cannot be inherited.\n  remarks: \"The <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> class provides methods for drawing objects to the display device. A <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> is associated with a specific device context.  \\n  \\n You can obtain a <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object by calling the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.CreateGraphics%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method on an object that inherits from <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control?displayProperty=fullName>, or by handling a control's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint?displayProperty=fullName> event and accessing the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs.Graphics%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs?displayProperty=fullName> class. You can also create a <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object from an image by using the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.FromImage%2A> method. For more information about creating a <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object, see [How to: Create Graphics Objects for Drawing](~/docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-create-graphics-objects-for-drawing.md).  \\n  \\n You can draw many different shapes and lines by using a <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object. For more information about how to draw lines and shapes, see the specific `Draw`*GraphicalElement* method for the line or shape you want to draw. These methods include <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawLine%2A>, <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawArc%2A>, <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawClosedCurve%2A>, <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawPolygon%2A>, and <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawRectangle%2A>. For more information about how to draw lines and shapes, see [Using a Pen to Draw Lines and Shapes](~/docs/framework/winforms/advanced/using-a-pen-to-draw-lines-and-shapes.md) and [Using a Brush to Fill Shapes](~/docs/framework/winforms/advanced/using-a-brush-to-fill-shapes.md).  \\n  \\n You can also draw images and icons by using the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawImage%2A> and <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawIcon%2A> methods, respectively. To perform a bit-block transfer of color data from the screen to the drawing surface of the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object, see <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.CopyFromScreen%2A>. For more information about how to draw images with a <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object, see [Working with Images, Bitmaps, Icons, and Metafiles](~/docs/framework/winforms/advanced/working-with-images-bitmaps-icons-and-metafiles.md).  \\n  \\n In addition, you can manipulate the coordinate system used by the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object. For more information on the coordinate system and how to manipulate it, see [Coordinate Systems and Transformations](~/docs/framework/winforms/advanced/coordinate-systems-and-transformations.md).\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example is designed for use with Windows Forms and requires a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs> object.
