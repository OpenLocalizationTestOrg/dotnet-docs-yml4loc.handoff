For example, you can use this class in a controlled system management software (SMS) environment or in situations where you need a complex installation that performs a number of pre-installation or post-installation operations on the local computer. Generally, you will want to use the members of this class in a specific order:  \\n  \\n1.  Create a new instance of <xref:System.Deployment.Application.InPlaceHostingManager>.  \\n  \\n2.  Download the deployment manifest by using <xref:System.Deployment.Application.InPlaceHostingManager.GetManifestAsync%2A>.  \\n  \\n3.  Check that the application can be run with the appropriate permissions by using <xref:System.Deployment.Application.InPlaceHostingManager.AssertApplicationRequirements%2A>.  \\n  \\n4.  Download and install the application by using <xref:System.Deployment.Application.InPlaceHostingManager.DownloadApplicationAsync%2A>.  \\n  \\n-   If you call any of these parameters out of order, they will throw an exception.  \\n  \\n <xref:System.Deployment.Application.InPlaceHostingManager> can install a [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](~/includes/ndptecclick-md.md)] application, but cannot execute it.

For more information on trusted publishers, see [Trusted Application Deployment Overview](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/b24a1702-8fbe-45b1-87a0-9618a0708f1d).  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  There is currently a product limitation that prevents <xref:System.Deployment.Application.InPlaceHostingManager> from working correctly when you debug your code using [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](~/includes/vsprvs-md.md)]. If you debug your application in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](~/includes/vsprvs-md.md)] by using the F5 key, the sample will throw mysterious exceptions when you call <xref:System.Deployment.Application.InPlaceHostingManager.DownloadApplicationAsync%2A>. To debug using [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](~/includes/vsprvs-md.md)], start the application without debugging, and then attach the debugger.
