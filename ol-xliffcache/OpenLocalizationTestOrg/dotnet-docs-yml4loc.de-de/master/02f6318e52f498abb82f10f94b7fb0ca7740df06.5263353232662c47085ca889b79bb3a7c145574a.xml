The code begins by setting the <xref:System.Web.HttpResponse.ContentType%2A> property to image/jpeg, so that the entire page will be rendered as a JPEG image. The code then calls the <xref:System.Web.HttpResponse.Clear%2A> method to ensure that no extraneous content is sent with this response. Next, the code sets the <xref:System.Web.HttpResponse.BufferOutput%2A> property to true so that the page is completely processed before it is sent to the requesting client. Two objects used to draw the rectangles are then created: a <xref:System.Drawing.Bitmap> and a <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object. The variables created in the page are used as coordinates to draw the rectangles and a string that appears inside the largest rectangle.  \\n  \\n When the three rectangles and the string that appears inside them are drawn, the <xref:System.Drawing.Bitmap> is saved to the <xref:System.IO.Stream> object that is associated with the <xref:System.Web.HttpResponse.OutputStream%2A> property and its format is set to JPEG.

Keep in mind the following guidelines:  \\n  \\n-   Ensure that you don't call into this API outside the bounds of a single request, because ASP.NET will dispose of the cancellation token at the end of the request. There is no guarantee that the token will ever transition to a canceled state before it is disposed. For example, if the request finishes without the client having disconnected, the token will be disposed without having first been canceled.  \\n  \\n-   Do not wait on the <xref:System.Threading.CancellationToken.WaitHandle%2A?displayProperty=fullName>, as this defeats the purpose of an asynchronous notification and can cause deadlocks.  \\n  \\n-   Do not call the <xref:System.Threading.CancellationToken.Register%2A?displayProperty=fullName> overloads which invoke the callback on the original <xref:System.Threading.SynchronizationContext> object.  \\n  \\n-   Do not use the <xref:System.Web.HttpContext> object or other non-thread-safe ASP.NET intrinsic objects from within the callback provided to the <xref:System.Threading.CancellationToken.Register%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method. The callback may be running concurrently with other ASP.NET or application code.  \\n  \\n-   Keep the callback methods short-running and non-blocking.  \\n  \\n-   Make every effort to avoid throwing exceptions from within the callback methods.  \\n  \\n This property is only applicable to Internet Information Service (IIS) 7.5 in integrated mode. If you invoke it without the right IIS version or pipeline mode, a <xref:System.PlatformNotSupportedException> is thrown. To determine the IIS version, use <xref:System.Web.HttpRuntime.IISVersion%2A>.

Malicious script that is embedded in input submitted to a Web site and later written back out to a client can appear to be originating from a trusted source. This security risk is referred to as a cross-site scripting attack. You should always validate data that is received from a client when it will be transmitted from your site to client browsers.  \\n  \\n Moreover, whenever you write out as HTML any data that was received as input, you should encode it using a technique such as <xref:System.Web.HttpServerUtility.HtmlEncode%2A> or <xref:System.Web.HttpServerUtility.UrlEncode%2A> to prevent malicious script from executing.
