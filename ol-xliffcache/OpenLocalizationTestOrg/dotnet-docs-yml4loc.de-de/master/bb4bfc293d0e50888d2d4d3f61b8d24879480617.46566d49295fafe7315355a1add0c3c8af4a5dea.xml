You can optionally configure ASP.NET membership to require a password question and answer to authenticate password reset or retrieval requests for users that have forgotten their password.  \n  \n Although ASP.NET membership is a self-standing feature in ASP.NET For authentication, it can be integrated with ASP.NET role management to provide authorization services for your site.

For details, see [Understanding Role Management](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/a0d2f19d-a2a7-496d-88b6-30133f8ea3d6) and [ASP.NET Profile Properties Overview](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/89439440-92ea-48c3-a4bd-dea40307899d).  \n  \n The <xref:System.Web.Security.Membership> class relies on membership providers to communicate with a data source. The .NET Framework includes a <xref:System.Web.Security.SqlMembershipProvider>, which stores user information in a Microsoft SQL Server database, and an <xref:System.Web.Security.ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider>, which enables you to store user information on an Active Directory or Active Directory Application Mode (ADAM) server. You can also implement a custom membership provider to communicate with an alternative data source that can be used by the <xref:System.Web.Security.Membership> class. Custom membership providers inherit the <xref:System.Web.Security.MembershipProvider> abstract class. For more information, see [Implementing a Membership Provider](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/d8658b8e-c962-4f64-95e1-4acce35e4582).  \n  \n By default, ASP.NET membership is enabled for all ASP.NET applications. The default membership provider is the <xref:System.Web.Security.SqlMembershipProvider> and is specified in the machine configuration with the name `AspNetSqlProvider`. The default instance of the <xref:System.Web.Security.SqlMembershipProvider> is configured to connect to a local instance of Microsoft SQL Server.  \n  \n You can modify the default settings to specify a <xref:System.Web.Security.SqlMembershipProvider> other than the `AspNetSqlProvider` instance as the default provider, or specify an instance of a custom provider as the default provider for your ASP.NET application using the Web.config file. You can specify the ASP.NET membership configuration for your Web application using the  configuration section in the Web.config file. You can use the `providers` subsection of the  section to specify a membership provider other than one of the default providers. For example, the following  section removes the default membership providers from the current application configuration and adds a new provider with a name of `SqlProvider` that connects to a SQL Server instance named `AspSqlServer`.  \n  \n```  \n<configuration>  \n  <connectionStrings>  \n    <add name=\"SqlServices\" connectionString=\"Data Source=AspSqlServer;Integrated Security=SSPI;Initial Catalog=aspnetdb;\" />  \n  </connectionStrings>  \n  <system.web>  \n    <membership defaultProvider=\"SqlProvider\" userIsOnlineTimeWindow=\"20\">  \n      <providers>  \n        <remove name=\"AspNetSqlProvider\" />  \n        <add name=\"SqlProvider\"  \n          type=\"System.Web.Security.SqlMembershipProvider\"  \n          connectionStringName=\"SqlServices\"  \n          enablePasswordRetrieval=\"false\"  \n          enablePasswordReset=\"true\"  \n          requiresQuestionAndAnswer=\"true\"  \n          passwordFormat=\"Hashed\"  \n          applicationName=\"/\" />  \n      </providers>  \n    </membership>  \n  </system.web>  \n</configuration>  \n```","nodes":[{"pos":[0,570],"content":"The <xref:System.Web.Security.Membership> class is used in ASP.NET applications to validate user credentials and manage user settings such as passwords and e-mail addresses.

This class cannot be inherited.\n  remarks: \"The <xref:System.Web.Security.Membership> class is used in ASP.NET applications to validate user credentials and manage user settings such as passwords and e-mail addresses. The <xref:System.Web.Security.Membership> class can be used on its own, or in conjunction with the <xref:System.Web.Security.FormsAuthentication> to create a complete system for authenticating users of a Web application or site. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Login> control encapsulates the <xref:System.Web.Security.Membership> class to provide a convenient mechanism for validating users.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  If you are not familiar with the membership features of ASP.NET, see [Introduction to Membership](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/79184d17-f4c7-4c9f-a073-cec4f5543980) before continuing. For a list of other topics related to membership, see [Managing Users by Using Membership](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/824c3a24-f0af-427c-a652-0d2d1e9397cd).  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Web.Security.Membership> class provides facilities for:  \\n  \\n-   Creating new users.  \\n  \\n-   Storing membership information (user names, passwords, e-mail addresses, and supporting data) in Microsoft SQL Server or in an alternative data store.  \\n  \\n-   Authenticating users who visit your site. You can authenticate users programmatically, or you can use the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Login> control to create a complete authentication system that requires little or no code.  \\n  \\n-   Managing passwords, which includes creating, changing, retrieving, and resetting them, and so on. You can optionally configure ASP.NET membership to require a password question and answer to authenticate password reset or retrieval requests for users that have forgotten their password.  \\n  \\n Although ASP.NET membership is a self-standing feature in ASP.NET For authentication, it can be integrated with ASP.NET role management to provide authorization services for your site. Membership can also be integrated with the ASP.NET user <xref:System.Web.Profile> to provide application-specific customization that can be tailored to individual users. For details, see [Understanding Role Management](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/a0d2f19d-a2a7-496d-88b6-30133f8ea3d6) and [ASP.NET Profile Properties Overview](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/89439440-92ea-48c3-a4bd-dea40307899d).  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Web.Security.Membership> class relies on membership providers to communicate with a data source. The .NET Framework includes a <xref:System.Web.Security.SqlMembershipProvider>, which stores user information in a Microsoft SQL Server database, and an <xref:System.Web.Security.ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider>, which enables you to store user information on an Active Directory or Active Directory Application Mode (ADAM) server. You can also implement a custom membership provider to communicate with an alternative data source that can be used by the <xref:System.Web.Security.Membership> class. Custom membership providers inherit the <xref:System.Web.Security.MembershipProvider> abstract class. For more information, see [Implementing a Membership Provider](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/d8658b8e-c962-4f64-95e1-4acce35e4582).  \\n  \\n By default, ASP.NET membership is enabled for all ASP.NET applications. The default membership provider is the <xref:System.Web.Security.SqlMembershipProvider> and is specified in the machine configuration with the name `AspNetSqlProvider`. The default instance of the <xref:System.Web.Security.SqlMembershipProvider> is configured to connect to a local instance of Microsoft SQL Server.  \\n  \\n You can modify the default settings to specify a <xref:System.Web.Security.SqlMembershipProvider> other than the `AspNetSqlProvider` instance as the default provider, or specify an instance of a custom provider as the default provider for your ASP.NET application using the Web.config file. You can specify the ASP.NET membership configuration for your Web application using the  configuration section in the Web.config file. You can use the `providers` subsection of the  section to specify a membership provider other than one of the default providers. For example, the following  section removes the default membership providers from the current application configuration and adds a new provider with a name of `SqlProvider` that connects to a SQL Server instance named `AspSqlServer`.  \\n  \\n```  \\n<configuration>  \\n  <connectionStrings>  \\n    <add name=\\\"SqlServices\\\" connectionString=\\\"Data Source=AspSqlServer;Integrated Security=SSPI;Initial Catalog=aspnetdb;\\\" />  \\n  </connectionStrings>  \\n  <system.web>  \\n    <membership defaultProvider=\\\"SqlProvider\\\" userIsOnlineTimeWindow=\\\"20\\\">  \\n      <providers>  \\n        <remove name=\\\"AspNetSqlProvider\\\" />  \\n        <add name=\\\"SqlProvider\\\"  \\n          type=\\\"System.Web.Security.SqlMembershipProvider\\\"  \\n          connectionStringName=\\\"SqlServices\\\"  \\n          enablePasswordRetrieval=\\\"false\\\"  \\n          enablePasswordReset=\\\"true\\\"  \\n          requiresQuestionAndAnswer=\\\"true\\\"  \\n          passwordFormat=\\\"Hashed\\\"  \\n          applicationName=\\\"/\\\" />  \\n      </providers>  \\n    </membership>  \\n  </system.web>  \\n</configuration>  \\n```\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example shows the login page for an ASP.NET application configured to use forms authentication and ASP.NET membership. If the supplied user credentials are invalid, a message is displayed to the user. Otherwise, the user is redirected to the originally requested URL using the <xref:System.Web.Security.FormsAuthentication.RedirectFromLoginPage%2A> method.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  The ASP.NET login controls (<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Login>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.LoginView>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.LoginStatus>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.LoginName>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.PasswordRecovery>) encapsulate virtually all of the logic required to prompt users for credentials and validate the credentials in the membership system and can be used in place of programmatic checking using the <xref:System.Web.Security.Membership> class.  \\n  \\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\n>  This example contains a text box that accepts user input, which is a potential security threat.
