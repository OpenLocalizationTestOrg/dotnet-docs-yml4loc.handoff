Each column represents a field, while each row represents a record. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control supports the following features:  \n  \n-   Binding to data source controls, such as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SqlDataSource>.  \n  \n-   Built-in sort capabilities.  \n  \n-   Built-in update and delete capabilities.  \n  \n-   Built-in paging capabilities.  \n  \n-   Built-in row selection capabilities.  \n  \n-   Programmatic access to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> object model to dynamically set properties, handle events, and so on.  \n  \n-   Multiple key fields.  \n  \n-   Multiple data fields for the hyperlink columns.  \n  \n-   Customizable appearance through themes and styles.  \n  \n-   To learn about the other data-bound controls that are available in ASP.NET, see [Data-Bound Web Server Controls](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/f9cf026e-d8b8-49f8-a3c4-64de2edbbb96).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  If you are familiar with the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.DataGrid> control from the .NET Framework version 1.0, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control is the successor to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.DataGrid> control.  \n  \n<a name=\"column_fields\"></a>   \n## Column Fields  \n Each column in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control is represented by a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.DataControlField> object. By default, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.AutoGenerateColumns%2A> property is set to `true`, which creates an <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AutoGeneratedField> object for each field in the data source. Each field is then rendered as a column in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control in the order that each field appears in the data source.  \n  \n You can also manually control which column fields appear in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control by setting the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.AutoGenerateColumns%2A> property to `false` and then defining your own column field collection. Different column field types determine the behavior of the columns in the control. The following table lists the different column field types that can be used.  \n  \n|Column field type|Description|  \n|-----------------------|-----------------|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.BoundField>|Displays the value of a field in a data source. This is the default column type of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.ButtonField>|Displays a command button for each item in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control. This enables you to create a column of custom button controls, such as the Add or the Remove button.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.CheckBoxField>|Displays a check box for each item in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control. This column field type is commonly used to display fields with a Boolean value.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.CommandField>|Displays predefined command buttons to perform select, edit, or delete operations.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.HyperLinkField>|Displays the value of a field in a data source as a hyperlink. This column field type enables you to bind a second field to the hyperlink's URL.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.ImageField>|Displays an image for each item in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.TemplateField>|Displays user-defined content for each item in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control according to a specified template. This column field type enables you to create a custom column field.|  \n  \n To define a column field collection declaratively, first add opening and closing `<Columns>` tags between the opening and closing tags of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control. Next, list the column fields that you want to include between the opening and closing `<Columns>` tags. The columns specified are added to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.Columns%2A> collection in the order listed. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.Columns%2A> collection stores all the column fields in the control and enables you to programmatically manage the column fields in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control.  \n  \n Explicitly declared column fields can be displayed in combination with automatically generated column fields. When both are used, explicitly declared column fields are rendered first, followed by the automatically generated column fields.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Automatically generated column fields are not added to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.Columns%2A> collection.  \n  \n<a name=\"binding_to_data\"></a>   \n## Binding to Data  \n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control can be bound to a data source control (such as the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SqlDataSource> control or <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.ObjectDataSource> control) or to any data source collection that implements the <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerable?displayProperty=fullName> interface, such as <xref:System.Data.DataView?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601?displayProperty=fullName>, or other collection types. Use one of the following methods to bind the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control to the appropriate data source type:  \n  \n-   To bind to a data source control, set the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.DataBoundControl.DataSourceID%2A> property of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control to the <xref:System.Web.UI.Control.ID%2A> value of the data source control. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control automatically binds to the specified data source control and can take advantage of the data source control's capabilities to perform sorting, updating, deleting, and paging. This is the preferred method to bind to data.  \n  \n-   To bind to a data source that implements the <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerable?displayProperty=fullName> interface, programmatically set the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.BaseDataBoundControl.DataSource%2A> property of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control to the data source and then call the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.BaseDataBoundControl.DataBind%2A> method. When using this method, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control does not provide built-in sort, update, delete, and paging functionality. You need to provide this functionality by using the appropriate event.  \n  \n For more information about data binding, see [ASP.NET Data Access Content Map](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/f9219396-a0fa-481f-894d-e3d9c67d64f2).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This control can be used to display user input, which might include malicious client script. Check any information that is sent from a client for executable script, SQL statements, or other code before displaying it in your application. Whenever possible, it is strongly recommended that values are HTML-encoded before they are displayed in this control (the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.BoundField> class HTML-encodes values by default). ASP.NET provides an input request validation feature to block script and HTML in user input. Validation server controls are also provided to assess user input. For more information, see [Introduction to the Validation Controls](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/3c0e7514-cff2-4bed-936d-ee3f7b740190).  \n  \n<a name=\"data_operations\"></a>   \n## Data Operations  \n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control provides many built-in capabilities that allow the user to sort, update, delete, select, and page through items in the control. When the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control is bound to a data source control, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control can take advantage of the data source control's capabilities and provide automatic sort, update, and delete functionality.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control can provide support for sorting, updating, and deleting with other types of data sources. However, you will need to provide an appropriate event handler with the implementation for these operations.  \n  \n Sorting allows the user to sort the items in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control with respect to a specific column by clicking on the column's header. To enable sorting, set the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.AllowSorting%2A> property to `true`.  \n  \n The automatic updating, deleting, and selection functionalities are enabled when a button in a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.ButtonField> or <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.TemplateField> column field, with a command name of \"Edit\", \"Delete\", and \"Select\", respectively, is clicked. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control can automatically add a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.CommandField> column field with an Edit, Delete, or Select button if the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.AutoGenerateEditButton%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.AutoGenerateDeleteButton%2A>, or <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.AutoGenerateSelectButton%2A> property is set to `true`, respectively.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Inserting records into the data source is not directly supported by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control. However, it is possible to insert records by using the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control in conjunction with the `DetailsView` or `FormView` control. For more information, see <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.DetailsView> or <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView>, respectively.  \n  \n Instead of displaying all the records in the data source at the same time, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control can automatically break the records up into pages. To enable paging, set the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.AllowPaging%2A> property to `true`.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control is re-created on postback based on the information that is stored in <xref:System.Web.UI.PageStatePersister.ViewState%2A>. If the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control includes a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.TemplateField> or a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.CommandField> with the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.CommandField.CausesValidation%2A> property set to `true`, then the <xref:System.Web.UI.Page.EnableViewState%2A> property must also be set to `true` to ensure that concurrent data operations, such as updates and deletes, apply to the appropriate row.  \n  \n<a name=\"customizing_the_user_interface\"></a>   \n## Customizing the User Interface  \n You can customize the appearance of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control by setting the style properties for the different parts of the control. The following table lists the different style properties.  \n  \n|Style property|Description|  \n|--------------------|-----------------|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.AlternatingRowStyle%2A>|The style settings for the alternating data rows in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control. When this property is set, the data rows are displayed alternating between the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.RowStyle%2A> settings and the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.AlternatingRowStyle%2A> settings.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.EditRowStyle%2A>|The style settings for the row being edited in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.EmptyDataRowStyle%2A>|The style settings for the empty data row displayed in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control when the data source does not contain any records.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.FooterStyle%2A>|The style settings for the footer row of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.HeaderStyle%2A>|The style settings for the header row of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.PagerStyle%2A>|The style settings for the pager row of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.RowStyle%2A>|The style settings for the data rows in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control. When the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.AlternatingRowStyle%2A> property is also set, the data rows are displayed alternating between the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.RowStyle%2A> settings and the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.AlternatingRowStyle%2A> settings.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.SelectedRowStyle%2A>|The style settings for the selected row in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.SortedAscendingCellStyle%2A>|The style setting for the data column the data is sorted by in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control. When this style is set, the style (for example, highlighted column) is applied to cells when the data is sorted in ascending order.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.SortedAscendingHeaderStyle%2A>|The style setting for the data column the data is sorted by in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control. When this style is set, an arrow indicating the data is sorted ascending is placed on the header of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control when the data is sorted in ascending order.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.SortedDescendingCellStyle%2A>|The style setting for the data column the data is sorted by in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control. When this style is set, the style (for example, highlighted column) is applied to cells when the data is sorted in descending order.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.SortedDescendingHeaderStyle%2A>|The style setting for the data column the data is sorted by in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control. When this style is set, an arrow pointing down is placed on the header of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> when the data is sorted in descending order.|  \n  \n You can also show or hide different parts of the control. The following table lists the properties that control which parts are shown or hidden.  \n  \n|Property|Description|  \n|--------------|-----------------|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.ShowFooter%2A>|Shows or hides the footer section of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.ShowHeader%2A>|Shows or hides the header section of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control.|  \n  \n<a name=\"events\"></a>   \n## Events  \n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control provides several events that you can program against. This enables you to run a custom routine whenever an event occurs. The following table lists the events that are supported by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control.  \n  \n|Event|Description|  \n|-----------|-----------------|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.PageIndexChanged>|Occurs when one of the pager buttons is clicked, but after the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control handles the paging operation. This event is commonly used when you need to perform a task after the user navigates to a different page in the control.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.PageIndexChanging>|Occurs when one of the pager buttons is clicked, but before the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control handles the paging operation. This event is often used to cancel the paging operation.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.RowCancelingEdit>|Occurs when a row's Cancel button is clicked, but before the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control exits edit mode. This event is often used to stop the canceling operation.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.RowCommand>|Occurs when a button is clicked in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control. This event is often used to perform a task when a button is clicked in the control.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.RowCreated>|Occurs when a new row is created in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control. This event is often used to modify the contents of a row when the row is created.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.RowDataBound>|Occurs when a data row is bound to data in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control. This event is often used to modify the contents of a row when the row is bound to data.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.RowDeleted>|Occurs when a row's Delete button is clicked, but after the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control deletes the record from the data source.

Each column represents a field, while each row represents a record. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control supports the following features:  \\n  \\n-   Binding to data source controls, such as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SqlDataSource>.  \\n  \\n-   Built-in sort capabilities.  \\n  \\n-   Built-in update and delete capabilities.  \\n  \\n-   Built-in paging capabilities.  \\n  \\n-   Built-in row selection capabilities.  \\n  \\n-   Programmatic access to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> object model to dynamically set properties, handle events, and so on.  \\n  \\n-   Multiple key fields.  \\n  \\n-   Multiple data fields for the hyperlink columns.  \\n  \\n-   Customizable appearance through themes and styles.  \\n  \\n-   To learn about the other data-bound controls that are available in ASP.NET, see [Data-Bound Web Server Controls](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/f9cf026e-d8b8-49f8-a3c4-64de2edbbb96).  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  If you are familiar with the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.DataGrid> control from the .NET Framework version 1.0, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control is the successor to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.DataGrid> control.  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"column_fields\\\"></a>   \\n## Column Fields  \\n Each column in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control is represented by a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.DataControlField> object. By default, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.AutoGenerateColumns%2A> property is set to `true`, which creates an <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.AutoGeneratedField> object for each field in the data source. Each field is then rendered as a column in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control in the order that each field appears in the data source.  \\n  \\n You can also manually control which column fields appear in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control by setting the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.AutoGenerateColumns%2A> property to `false` and then defining your own column field collection. Different column field types determine the behavior of the columns in the control. The following table lists the different column field types that can be used.  \\n  \\n|Column field type|Description|  \\n|-----------------------|-----------------|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.BoundField>|Displays the value of a field in a data source. This is the default column type of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.ButtonField>|Displays a command button for each item in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control. This enables you to create a column of custom button controls, such as the Add or the Remove button.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.CheckBoxField>|Displays a check box for each item in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control. This column field type is commonly used to display fields with a Boolean value.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.CommandField>|Displays predefined command buttons to perform select, edit, or delete operations.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.HyperLinkField>|Displays the value of a field in a data source as a hyperlink. This column field type enables you to bind a second field to the hyperlink's URL.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.ImageField>|Displays an image for each item in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.TemplateField>|Displays user-defined content for each item in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control according to a specified template. This column field type enables you to create a custom column field.|  \\n  \\n To define a column field collection declaratively, first add opening and closing `<Columns>` tags between the opening and closing tags of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control. Next, list the column fields that you want to include between the opening and closing `<Columns>` tags. The columns specified are added to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.Columns%2A> collection in the order listed. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.Columns%2A> collection stores all the column fields in the control and enables you to programmatically manage the column fields in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control.  \\n  \\n Explicitly declared column fields can be displayed in combination with automatically generated column fields. When both are used, explicitly declared column fields are rendered first, followed by the automatically generated column fields.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  Automatically generated column fields are not added to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.Columns%2A> collection.  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"binding_to_data\\\"></a>   \\n## Binding to Data  \\n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control can be bound to a data source control (such as the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SqlDataSource> control or <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.ObjectDataSource> control) or to any data source collection that implements the <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerable?displayProperty=fullName> interface, such as <xref:System.Data.DataView?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601?displayProperty=fullName>, or other collection types. Use one of the following methods to bind the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control to the appropriate data source type:  \\n  \\n-   To bind to a data source control, set the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.DataBoundControl.DataSourceID%2A> property of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control to the <xref:System.Web.UI.Control.ID%2A> value of the data source control. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control automatically binds to the specified data source control and can take advantage of the data source control's capabilities to perform sorting, updating, deleting, and paging. This is the preferred method to bind to data.  \\n  \\n-   To bind to a data source that implements the <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerable?displayProperty=fullName> interface, programmatically set the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.BaseDataBoundControl.DataSource%2A> property of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control to the data source and then call the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.BaseDataBoundControl.DataBind%2A> method. When using this method, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control does not provide built-in sort, update, delete, and paging functionality. You need to provide this functionality by using the appropriate event.  \\n  \\n For more information about data binding, see [ASP.NET Data Access Content Map](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/f9219396-a0fa-481f-894d-e3d9c67d64f2).  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  This control can be used to display user input, which might include malicious client script. Check any information that is sent from a client for executable script, SQL statements, or other code before displaying it in your application. Whenever possible, it is strongly recommended that values are HTML-encoded before they are displayed in this control (the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.BoundField> class HTML-encodes values by default). ASP.NET provides an input request validation feature to block script and HTML in user input. Validation server controls are also provided to assess user input. For more information, see [Introduction to the Validation Controls](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/3c0e7514-cff2-4bed-936d-ee3f7b740190).  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"data_operations\\\"></a>   \\n## Data Operations  \\n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control provides many built-in capabilities that allow the user to sort, update, delete, select, and page through items in the control. When the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control is bound to a data source control, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control can take advantage of the data source control's capabilities and provide automatic sort, update, and delete functionality.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control can provide support for sorting, updating, and deleting with other types of data sources. However, you will need to provide an appropriate event handler with the implementation for these operations.  \\n  \\n Sorting allows the user to sort the items in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control with respect to a specific column by clicking on the column's header. To enable sorting, set the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.AllowSorting%2A> property to `true`.  \\n  \\n The automatic updating, deleting, and selection functionalities are enabled when a button in a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.ButtonField> or <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.TemplateField> column field, with a command name of \\\"Edit\\\", \\\"Delete\\\", and \\\"Select\\\", respectively, is clicked. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control can automatically add a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.CommandField> column field with an Edit, Delete, or Select button if the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.AutoGenerateEditButton%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.AutoGenerateDeleteButton%2A>, or <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.AutoGenerateSelectButton%2A> property is set to `true`, respectively.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  Inserting records into the data source is not directly supported by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control. However, it is possible to insert records by using the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control in conjunction with the `DetailsView` or `FormView` control. For more information, see <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.DetailsView> or <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.FormView>, respectively.  \\n  \\n Instead of displaying all the records in the data source at the same time, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control can automatically break the records up into pages. To enable paging, set the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.AllowPaging%2A> property to `true`.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView> control is re-created on postback based on the information that is stored in <xref:System.Web.UI.PageStatePersister.ViewState%2A>.
