System.Runtime\n  - mscorlib\n  - netstandard\n  namespace: System\n  summary: Represents a 4-tuple, or quadruple.\n  remarks: \"A tuple is a data structure that has a specific number and sequence of values. The <xref:System.Tuple%604> class represents a 4-tuple, or quadruple, which is a tuple that has four components.  \\n  \\n You can instantiate a <xref:System.Tuple%604> object by calling either the <xref:System.Tuple%604.%23ctor%2A> constructor or the static <xref:System.Tuple.Create%60%604%28%60%600%2C%60%601%2C%60%602%2C%60%603%29?displayProperty=fullName> method. You can retrieve the value of the tuple's components by using the read-only <xref:System.Tuple%604.Item1%2A>, <xref:System.Tuple%604.Item2%2A>, <xref:System.Tuple%604.Item3%2A>, and <xref:System.Tuple%604.Item4%2A> instance properties.  \\n  \\n Tuples are commonly used in four different ways:  \\n  \\n-   To represent a single set of data. For example, a tuple can represent a database record, and its components can represent individual fields of the record.  \\n  \\n-   To provide easy access to, and manipulation of, a data set. The following example defines an array of <xref:System.Tuple%604> objects that contain the names of baseball pitchers, the number of innings they pitched, and the number of earned runs (runs that scored without fielding errors), and hits that they gave up. The array is passed to the `ComputeStatistics` method, which calculates each pitcher's earned run average (the average number of runs given up in a nine-inning game), and the average number of hits given up per inning. The method also uses these two averages to compute a hypothetical effectiveness average.  \\n  \\n     [!code-csharp[System.Tuple\\\\`4.Class#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.tuple`4.class/cs/example1.cs#1)]\\n     [!code-vb[System.Tuple\\\\`4.Class#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.tuple`4.class/vb/example1.vb#1)]  \\n  \\n-   To return multiple values from a method without the use of `out` parameters (in C#) or `ByRef` parameters (in Visual Basic). For example, the previous example returns its computed statistics, along with the name of the pitcher, in an array of <xref:System.Tuple%604> objects.  \\n  \\n-   To pass multiple values to a method through a single parameter. For example, the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Start%28System.Object%29?displayProperty=fullName> method has a single parameter that lets you supply one value to the method that the thread executes at startup.

It this method call returns true, it also calls the `obj.Equals` method to evaluate the tuples' <xref:System.Tuple%604.Item4%2A> property values. As a result, the method tests for equality based only on the values of the <xref:System.Tuple%604.Item3%2A> and <xref:System.Tuple%604.Item4%2A> properties. The output illustrates the result for a data set of <xref:System.Tuple%604> objects that record the name of a U.S. city, the month of a year, and the average high and low temperature for that month.  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[System.Tuple\\\\`4.Equals#2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.tuple`4.equals/cs/equals2.cs#2)]\\n [!code-vb[System.Tuple\\\\`4.Equals#2](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.tuple`4.equals/vb/equals2.vb#2)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: bool IStructuralEquatable.Equals (object other, System.Collections.IEqualityComparer comparer);\n    parameters:\n    - id: other\n      type: System.Object\n      description: The object to compare with this instance.\n    - id: comparer\n      type: System.Collections.IEqualityComparer\n      description: An object that defines the method to use to evaluate whether the two objects are equal.\n    return:\n      type: System.Boolean\n      description: '`true` if the current instance is equal to the specified object; otherwise, `false`.'\n  overload: System.Tuple`4.System#Collections#IStructuralEquatable#Equals*\n  exceptions: []\n  version:\n  - netcore-1.0\n  - netcore-1.1\n  - netcore-2.0\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  - netstandard-1.0\n  - netstandard-1.1\n  - netstandard-1.2\n  - netstandard-1.3\n  - netstandard-1.4\n  - netstandard-1.5\n  - netstandard-1.6\n  - netstandard-2.0\n  - xamarinandroid-7.1\n  - xamarinios-10.8\n  - xamarinmac-3.0\n  monikers:\n  - netcore-1.0\n  - netcore-1.1\n  - netcore-2.0\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  - netstandard-1.0\n  - netstandard-1.1\n  - netstandard-1.2\n  - netstandard-1.3\n  - netstandard-1.4\n  - netstandard-1.5\n  - netstandard-1.6\n  - netstandard-2.0\n  - xamarinandroid-7.1\n  - xamarinios-10.8\n  - xamarinmac-3.0\n  content_git_url: https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/xml/System/Tuple`4.xml\n  ms.technology:\n  - dotnet-standard\n  author: rpetrusha\n  ms.author: ronpet\n  manager: wpickett\n- uid: System.Tuple`4.System#Collections#IStructuralEquatable#GetHashCode(System.Collections.IEqualityComparer)\n  commentId: M:System.Tuple`4.System#Collections#IStructuralEquatable#GetHashCode(System.Collections.IEqualityComparer)\n  id: System#Collections#IStructuralEquatable#GetHashCode(System.Collections.IEqualityComparer)\n  isEii: true\n  parent: System.Tuple`4\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: IStructuralEquatable.GetHashCode(IEqualityComparer)\n  nameWithType: Tuple<T1,T2,T3,T4>.IStructuralEquatable.GetHashCode(IEqualityComparer)\n  fullName: Tuple<T1,T2,T3,T4>.IStructuralEquatable.GetHashCode(IEqualityComparer)\n  type: Method\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Runtime\n  - mscorlib\n  - netstandard\n  namespace: System\n  summary: Calculates the hash code for the current <xref href=\"System.Tuple`4\"></xref> object by using a specified computation method.\n  remarks: \"This member is an explicit interface member implementation.
