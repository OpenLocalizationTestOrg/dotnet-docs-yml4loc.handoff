the cache of changes to the monitored items. This class cannot be inherited.\n  remarks: \"The <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.HostFileChangeMonitor> class is a concrete implementation of the <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.FileChangeMonitor> type. This class is sealed, therefore it cannot be extended. This class is useful if you want to use an existing cache implementation and to monitor files and directories for changes.  \\n  \\n For each specified file or directory path, the <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.HostFileChangeMonitor> class triggers a change notification if any of the following changes occur:  \\n  \\n-   The name of the monitored file or directory changes.  \\n  \\n-   The specified file or directory did not exist at the time the monitor was created, but was created later. In other words, a file or directory was created in the scope of the monitored items.  \\n  \\n-   The size of a monitored file changed.  \\n  \\n-   The contents of a monitored file changed, or the contents of a monitored directory changed.  \\n  \\n-   The access control list (ACL) of the file or directory was changed.  \\n  \\n-   The monitored file or directory was deleted.  \\n  \\n If too many changes occur for the monitored file or directory at the same time, the <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.HostFileChangeMonitor> instance can lose track of specific changes. In this scenario, the <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.HostFileChangeMonitor> class triggers a change notification. This scenario is more likely to occur when the <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.HostFileChangeMonitor> instance monitors a directory, and many changes occur in the scope of the directory structure in a short period of time.  \\n  \\n Because the purpose of the <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.HostFileChangeMonitor> class is only to signal that something has changed among the set of monitored files and directories, it is not considered important that details about a specific change are not captured. The purpose of the <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.HostFileChangeMonitor> class is to provide notification that state changed so that a cache entry (or entries) can be evicted. Because the <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.HostFileChangeMonitor> class does not indicate exactly what changed, internal-change tracking overflow is irrelevant.  \\n  \\n When you supply paths to a <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.HostFileChangeMonitor> instance, the directory and file paths must be full paths to the directory or file. Relative paths and wildcard characters in paths are not allowed.  \\n  \\n When the <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.HostFileChangeMonitor> class is used in an ASP.NET application, the Windows identity that is used for access to monitored items is the application identity for the ASP.NET application. In other words, the application identity will be one of the following:  \\n  \\n-   The process identity.  \\n  \\n-   The configured application identity.  \\n  \\n-   The UNC credential if the application is running from a UNC share.  \\n  \\n When the <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.HostFileChangeMonitor> class is used in a non-ASP.NET application, the <xref:System.IO.FileSystemWatcher> class is used internally to monitor files. As a result, whatever access control list (ACL) applies to a monitored file or directory is applied to the Windows identity of the current thread.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  Callers must have the appropriate level of code access security (CAS) permissions and must have NTFS permissions to all monitored directories and paths.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following example creates a cache item that uses a <xref:System.Runtime.Caching.HostFileChangeMonitor> object to monitor the state of the source data (which is a file) on the file system.
