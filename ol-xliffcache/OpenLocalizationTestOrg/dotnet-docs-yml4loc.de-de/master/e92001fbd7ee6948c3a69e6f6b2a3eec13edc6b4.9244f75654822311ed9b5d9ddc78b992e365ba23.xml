This typically occurs when calling some methods of the <xref:System.Convert> class and the `Parse` and `ParseExact` methods of some types.  \n  \n     In most cases, particularly if the string that you're converting is input by a user or read from a file, you should use a `try/catch` block and handle the <xref:System.FormatException> exception if the conversion is unsuccessful. You can also replace the call to the conversion method with a call to a `TryParse` or `TryParseExact` method, if one exists. However, a <xref:System.FormatException> exception that is thrown when you're trying to parse a predefined or hard-coded string indicates a program error. In this case, you should correct the error rather than handle the exception.  \n  \n     The conversion of a string to the following types in the <xref:System> namespace can throw a <xref:System.FormatException> exception:  \n  \n    -   <xref:System.Boolean>. The <xref:System.Boolean.Parse%28System.String%29?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Convert.ToBoolean%28System.String%29?displayProperty=fullName> methods require the string to be converted to be \"True\", \"true\", \"False\", or \"false\". Any other value throws a <xref:System.FormatException> exception.  \n  \n    -   <xref:System.DateTime> and <xref:System.DateTimeOffset>. All date and time data is interpreted based on the formatting conventions of a particular culture: either the current thread culture (or, in some cases, the current application domain culture), the invariant culture, or a specified culture. When you call the <xref:System.DateTime.ParseExact%28System.String%2CSystem.String%2CSystem.IFormatProvider%2CSystem.Globalization.DateTimeStyles%29?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.DateTimeOffset.ParseExact%28System.String%2CSystem.String%5B%5D%2CSystem.IFormatProvider%2CSystem.Globalization.DateTimeStyles%29?displayProperty=fullName> methods, date and time data must also conform *exactly* to a pattern specified by one or more [standard format strings](~/docs/standard/base-types/standard-date-and-time-format-strings.md) or [custom format strings](~/docs/standard/base-types/custom-date-and-time-format-strings.md) that are provided as arguments in the method call. If it doesn't conform to an expected culture-specific pattern, a <xref:System.FormatException> exception is thrown. This means that date and time data saved in a culture-specific format on one system might not parse successfully on another system.  \n  \n         For more information about parsing dates and times, see [Parsing Date and Time Strings](~/docs/standard/base-types/parsing-datetime.md) and the documentation for the method that threw the exception.  \n  \n    -   **GUIDs.** The string representation of a GUID must consist of 32 hexadecimal digits (0-F), and must be in one of the five formats output by the <xref:System.Guid.ToString%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method. For more information, see the <xref:System.Guid.Parse%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method.  \n  \n    -   **Numeric types, including all signed integers, unsigned integers, and floating-point types.** The string to be parsed must consist of the Latin digits 0-9. A positive or negative sign, decimal separator, group separators, and currency symbol may also be permitted. Trying to parse a string that contains any other character always throws a <xref:System.FormatException> exception.  \n  \n         All numeric strings are interpreted based on the formatting conventions of a particular culture: either the current thread culture (or, in some cases, the current application domain culture), the invariant culture, or a specified culture. As a result, a numeric string that is parsed by using the conventions of one culture might fail when using the conventions of another.  \n  \n         For more information about parsing numeric strings, see [Parsing Numeric Strings](~/docs/standard/base-types/parsing-numeric.md) and the documentation for the specific method that threw the exception.  \n  \n    -   **Time intervals.** The string to be parsed must be either in fixed culture-insensitive format or in a culture-sensitive format defined by the current thread culture (or, in some cases, the current application domain culture), the invariant culture, or a specified culture. If the string isn't in an appropriate format, or if, at the minimum, the days, hours, and minutes components of the time interval aren't present, the parsing method throws a <xref:System.FormatException> exception. For more information, see the documentation for the <xref:System.TimeSpan> parsing method that threw the exception.  \n  \n-   A type implements the <xref:System.IFormattable> interface, which supports format strings that define how an object is converted to its string representation, and an invalid format string is used. This is most common in a formatting operation. In the following example, the \"Q\" standard format string is used in a composite format string to format a number.

In the following example, the string representation of a GUID is expected to conform to the pattern specified by the \"G\" standard format string.

In the following example, the largest index of a format item in the format string is 3. Because the indexes of items in the object list are zero-based, this format string would require the object list to have four items. Instead, it has only three, `dat`, `temp`, and `scale`, so the code results in a <xref:System.FormatException> exception at run time:.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[System.FormatException#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.formatexception/cs/example1.cs#1)]\n     [!code-vb[System.FormatException#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.formatexception/vb/example1.vb#1)]  \n  \n     In this case, the <xref:System.FormatException> exception is a result of developer error.

This occurs because no explicit conversion between array types exists, so instead the compiler treats the array as a single argument rather than as a parameter array. For example, the following call to the <xref:System.Console.WriteLine%28System.String%2CSystem.Object%5B%5D%29?displayProperty=fullName> method throws a <xref:System.FormatException> exception, although the highest index of the format items is 3, and the parameter array of type <xref:System.Int32> has four elements.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[System.FormatException#5](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.formatexception/cs/qa1.cs#5)]\n     [!code-vb[System.FormatException#5](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.formatexception/vb/qa1.vb#5)]  \n  \n     Instead of handling this exception, you should eliminate its cause.

This typically occurs when calling some methods of the <xref:System.Convert> class and the `Parse` and `ParseExact` methods of some types.  \\n  \\n     In most cases, particularly if the string that you're converting is input by a user or read from a file, you should use a `try/catch` block and handle the <xref:System.FormatException> exception if the conversion is unsuccessful. You can also replace the call to the conversion method with a call to a `TryParse` or `TryParseExact` method, if one exists. However, a <xref:System.FormatException> exception that is thrown when you're trying to parse a predefined or hard-coded string indicates a program error. In this case, you should correct the error rather than handle the exception.  \\n  \\n     The conversion of a string to the following types in the <xref:System> namespace can throw a <xref:System.FormatException> exception:  \\n  \\n    -   <xref:System.Boolean>. The <xref:System.Boolean.Parse%28System.String%29?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Convert.ToBoolean%28System.String%29?displayProperty=fullName> methods require the string to be converted to be \\\"True\\\", \\\"true\\\", \\\"False\\\", or \\\"false\\\". Any other value throws a <xref:System.FormatException> exception.  \\n  \\n    -   <xref:System.DateTime> and <xref:System.DateTimeOffset>. All date and time data is interpreted based on the formatting conventions of a particular culture: either the current thread culture (or, in some cases, the current application domain culture), the invariant culture, or a specified culture. When you call the <xref:System.DateTime.ParseExact%28System.String%2CSystem.String%2CSystem.IFormatProvider%2CSystem.Globalization.DateTimeStyles%29?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.DateTimeOffset.ParseExact%28System.String%2CSystem.String%5B%5D%2CSystem.IFormatProvider%2CSystem.Globalization.DateTimeStyles%29?displayProperty=fullName> methods, date and time data must also conform *exactly* to a pattern specified by one or more [standard format strings](~/docs/standard/base-types/standard-date-and-time-format-strings.md) or [custom format strings](~/docs/standard/base-types/custom-date-and-time-format-strings.md) that are provided as arguments in the method call. If it doesn't conform to an expected culture-specific pattern, a <xref:System.FormatException> exception is thrown. This means that date and time data saved in a culture-specific format on one system might not parse successfully on another system.  \\n  \\n         For more information about parsing dates and times, see [Parsing Date and Time Strings](~/docs/standard/base-types/parsing-datetime.md) and the documentation for the method that threw the exception.  \\n  \\n    -   **GUIDs.** The string representation of a GUID must consist of 32 hexadecimal digits (0-F), and must be in one of the five formats output by the <xref:System.Guid.ToString%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method. For more information, see the <xref:System.Guid.Parse%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method.  \\n  \\n    -   **Numeric types, including all signed integers, unsigned integers, and floating-point types.** The string to be parsed must consist of the Latin digits 0-9. A positive or negative sign, decimal separator, group separators, and currency symbol may also be permitted. Trying to parse a string that contains any other character always throws a <xref:System.FormatException> exception.  \\n  \\n         All numeric strings are interpreted based on the formatting conventions of a particular culture: either the current thread culture (or, in some cases, the current application domain culture), the invariant culture, or a specified culture. As a result, a numeric string that is parsed by using the conventions of one culture might fail when using the conventions of another.  \\n  \\n         For more information about parsing numeric strings, see [Parsing Numeric Strings](~/docs/standard/base-types/parsing-numeric.md) and the documentation for the specific method that threw the exception.  \\n  \\n    -   **Time intervals.** The string to be parsed must be either in fixed culture-insensitive format or in a culture-sensitive format defined by the current thread culture (or, in some cases, the current application domain culture), the invariant culture, or a specified culture. If the string isn't in an appropriate format, or if, at the minimum, the days, hours, and minutes components of the time interval aren't present, the parsing method throws a <xref:System.FormatException> exception. For more information, see the documentation for the <xref:System.TimeSpan> parsing method that threw the exception.  \\n  \\n-   A type implements the <xref:System.IFormattable> interface, which supports format strings that define how an object is converted to its string representation, and an invalid format string is used. This is most common in a formatting operation. In the following example, the \\\"Q\\\" standard format string is used in a composite format string to format a number. However, \\\"Q\\\" is not a valid [standard format string](~/docs/standard/base-types/standard-numeric-format-strings.md).  \\n  \\n     [!code-csharp[System.FormatException#7](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.formatexception/cs/iformattable1.cs#7)]\\n     [!code-vb[System.FormatException#7](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.formatexception/vb/iformattable1.vb#7)]  \\n  \\n     This exception results from a coding error.

In the following example, the string representation of a GUID is expected to conform to the pattern specified by the \\\"G\\\" standard format string.

Because the indexes of items in the object list are zero-based, this format string would require the object list to have four items.

It should be corrected rather than handled in a `try/catch` block by making sure that each item in the object list corresponds to the index of a format item.

This occurs because no explicit conversion between array types exists, so instead the compiler treats the array as a single argument rather than as a parameter array. For example, the following call to the <xref:System.Console.WriteLine%28System.String%2CSystem.Object%5B%5D%29?displayProperty=fullName> method throws a <xref:System.FormatException> exception, although the highest index of the format items is 3, and the parameter array of type <xref:System.Int32> has four elements.  \\n  \\n     [!code-csharp[System.FormatException#5](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.formatexception/cs/qa1.cs#5)]\\n     [!code-vb[System.FormatException#5](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.formatexception/vb/qa1.vb#5)]  \\n  \\n     Instead of handling this exception, you should eliminate its cause.
