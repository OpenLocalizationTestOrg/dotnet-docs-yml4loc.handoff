A cubic Bezier curve is defined by a start point, an end point, and two control points. The two coordinates in the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.KeySpline> defines those two control points. When describing key splines, the start point of the Bezier curve is always 0, and the end point is always 1, which is why you define only the two control points. The resulting curve specifies how an animation is interpolated during a time segment; that is, the curve represents the rate of change in the animation's target attribute over the time segment.
