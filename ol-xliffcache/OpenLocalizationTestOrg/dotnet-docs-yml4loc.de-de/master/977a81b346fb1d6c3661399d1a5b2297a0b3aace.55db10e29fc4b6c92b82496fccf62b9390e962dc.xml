A <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Popup> can have a maximum of one child, which can be any <xref:System.Windows.UIElement>.  \\n  \\n The following illustration shows a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Popup> control that has a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> as its parent.  \\n  \\n ![Popup illustration](~/add/media/popuppicture.JPG \\\"Popup illustration\\\")  \\n  \\n You can position a popup by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Popup.PlacementTarget%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Popup.PlacementRectangle%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Popup.Placement%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Popup.HorizontalOffset%2A>, and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Popup.VerticalOffsetProperty> properties. For more information, see [Popup Placement Behavior](~/docs/framework/wpf/controls/popup-placement-behavior.md). When <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Popup> is displayed on the screen, it does not reposition itself if its parent is repositioned.  \\n  \\n A <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Popup> displays its content in its own window on the screen. A <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Popup> control supports animation when the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Popup.AllowsTransparency%2A> property is set to `true` and the application is running with full trust. An application that is running with full trust has complete access to system resources and is typically installed on the user's system. For more information, see[Security (WPF)](~/docs/framework/wpf/security-wpf.md).  \\n  \\n For bitmap and opacity effects to appear on the content of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Popup>, you must set the effects directly on the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Popup> content. The content of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Popup> does not inherit effects that are set on the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Popup> control or on any other element that is in the parent window.  \\n  \\n A <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Popup> is sized to its content by default. When this occurs, applying a <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.RenderTransform%2A> or bitmap effects may cause the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Popup> to be obscured. This occurs because the default size of the content does not provide enough area for the effects to display. If more space is required, you can define a margin around the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Popup> content to increase the area that is available to the control.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Parent%2A> property must be set on the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Popup> when used in a [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winfxwebapp](~/includes/tlasharptla-winfxwebapp-md.md)].  \\n  \\n To create a tooltip, use the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ToolTip> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ToolTipService> classes. For more information, see [ToolTip Overview](~/docs/framework/wpf/controls/tooltip-overview.md).\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following example shows how to create a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Popup> control.  \\n  \\n [!code-xml[PopupSimple#2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/PopupSimple/CSharp/Window1.xaml#2)]  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[PopupSimple#CreatePopup](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/PopupSimple/CSharp/Window1.xaml.cs#createpopup)]\\n [!code-vb[PopupSimple#CreatePopup](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/PopupSimple/VisualBasic/Window1.xaml.vb#createpopup)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: >-\n      [System.Windows.Localizability(System.Windows.LocalizationCategory.None)]\n\n      [System.Windows.Markup.ContentProperty(\"Child\")]\n\n      public class Popup : System.Windows.FrameworkElement, System.Windows.Markup.IAddChild\n  inheritance:\n  -
