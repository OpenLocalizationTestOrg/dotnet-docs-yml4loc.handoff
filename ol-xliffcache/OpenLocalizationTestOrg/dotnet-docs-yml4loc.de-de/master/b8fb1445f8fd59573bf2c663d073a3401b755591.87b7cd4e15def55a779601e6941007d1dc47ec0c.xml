When you use this method, the metadata is automatically generated for the new <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty> and its owner type. The auto-generated metadata is the result of the merged metadata from all of the base types that have this property defined. If no merged metadata is available, then the default metadata for the property is used. If the property is registered by using the <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.RegisterAttached%2A> method, then the default metadata is the same as the metadata that is created when <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.RegisterAttached%2A> was called. Otherwise, the <xref:System.Windows.PropertyMetadata> object is created with the <xref:System.Windows.PropertyMetadata.DefaultValue%2A> property set to the property type's default and all other properties of the <xref:System.Windows.PropertyMetadata> is set to `null`.

The identifier provides access to the dependency property if you want to call property system [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_api#plural](~/includes/tla2sharptla-apisharpplural-md.md)] against the dependency property, particularly as it exists on the adding owner class. The same property name for both original owner and added owner should be used to indicate the similar functionality. You should use the <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty> return value of the <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.AddOwner%2A> method to define the dependency property identifier, and also to declare [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_clr](~/includes/tla2sharptla-clr-md.md)] property wrappers, for dependency properties that are added to types using <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.AddOwner%2A>.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.AddOwner%2A> methodology recommended above is used when creating the dependency properties that are declared within [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)].

For instance, both <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control> define a `BorderBrush` dependency property, which have similar functionality. <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control> defines its `BorderBrush` property to the property system by calling <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.AddOwner%2A> on original owner <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border> and its registered <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border.BorderBrushProperty> dependency property identifer. The <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.AddOwner%2A> return value is then used to establish a static <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty> field (<xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.BorderBrushProperty>)for that property on the added owner, and a `BorderBrush` property wrapper is also declared.  \\n  \\n The added owner's dependency property identifier should be used for operations such as <xref:System.Windows.DependencyObject.GetValue%2A>. However, type-specific operations involving either types or instances of the class that was added as owner with different metadata will still return the expected results even if the original (not the added owner's) dependency property identifier is specified in calls to methods such as <xref:System.Windows.DependencyObject.GetValue%2A> or <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.GetMetadata%2A>. The metadata for the added owner is perpetuated by the <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.AddOwner%2A> call itself, not necessarily referenced exclusively by the adding owner class identifier field. Nevertheless, it is good practice to expose the  identifier, as well as new [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_clr](~/includes/tla2sharptla-clr-md.md)] property wrappers, for dependency properties that are added to types using <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.AddOwner%2A>, because failing to do so creates disparity between the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_clr](~/includes/tla2sharptla-clr-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] representations of your properties.  \\n  \\n The supplied metadata is merged with the property metadata for the dependency property as it exists on the base owner. Any characteristics that were specified in the original base metadata will persist. Only those characteristics that were specifically changed in the new metadata will override the characteristics of the base metadata. Some characteristics, such as <xref:System.Windows.PropertyMetadata.DefaultValue%2A>, are replaced if they are specified in the new metadata. Others, such as <xref:System.Windows.PropertyChangedCallback>, are combined.
