This inactivity timer fires if no messages, either application or infrastructure, are received within the timeout period. An infrastructure message is a message that is generated for the purpose of one of the protocols in the channel stack, such as a keep alive or an acknowledgment, rather than containing application data.  \\n  \\n-   The second inactivity timer is on the service and uses the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.Binding.ReceiveTimeout%2A> setting of the binding. This inactivity timer fires if no application messages are received within the timeout period.  \\n  \\n Since the connection is dropped if either inactivity timer fires, increasing <xref:System.ServiceModel.ReliableSession.InactivityTimeout%2A> once it is greater than <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.Binding.ReceiveTimeout%2A> has no effect. The default for both of these timeouts is 10 minutes, so you always have to increase both of them to make a difference when using a reliable session.\"\n  example:\n  - >-\n    [!code-csharp[UEReliableSession#2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/uereliablesession/cs/program.cs#2)]\n     [!code-vb[UEReliableSession#2](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/uereliablesession/vb/program.vb#2)]\n  syntax:\n    content: public TimeSpan InactivityTimeout { get; set; }\n    return:\n      type: System.TimeSpan\n      description: The <xref href=\"System.TimeSpan\"></xref> that specifies the interval of time that a service remains inactive before closing.
