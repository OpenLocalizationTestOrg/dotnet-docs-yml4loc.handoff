This example assumes that a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListBox> control called `listBox1` has been added to a form and that the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListBox.DrawItem> event is handled by the event handler defined in the example code. The example also assumes that items have been added to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListBox.DrawItem> with the text of \\\"Apple\\\", \\\"Orange\\\", and \\\"Plum\\\" in that order.  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[ListBox.DrawMode#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/ListBox.DrawMode/CS/form1.cs#1)]\\n [!code-vb[ListBox.DrawMode#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/ListBox.DrawMode/VB/form1.vb#1)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: public enum DrawMode\n  inheritance:\n  -
