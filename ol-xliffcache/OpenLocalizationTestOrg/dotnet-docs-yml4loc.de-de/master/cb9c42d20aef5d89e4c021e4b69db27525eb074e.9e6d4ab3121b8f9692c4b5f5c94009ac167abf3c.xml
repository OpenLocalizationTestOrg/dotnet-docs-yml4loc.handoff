Declaring an object variable with the `As Object` clause creates a variable that can contain a reference to any type of object. However, access to the object through that variable is *late-bound*, that is, the binding occurs when your program runs. There are many reasons you should avoid late binding, including slower application performance.  \n  \n You can create an object variable that results in early binding—that is, binding when the program is compiled. To do so, add a reference to the type library for your object from the **COM** tab of the **Add Reference** dialog box on the **Project** menu. Then declare the object variable of the specific type of your object. In most cases, it is more efficient to use the `Dim` statement and a primary interop assembly to create objects than it is to use the `CreateObject` function.  \n  \n## Interacting with Unmanaged Code  \n Another issue is that COM objects use unmanaged code — code without the benefit of the common language runtime. There is a fair degree of complexity involved in mixing the managed code of Visual Basic with unmanaged code from COM. When you add a reference to a COM object, Visual Basic searches for a primary interop assembly (PIA) for that library; if it finds one, then it uses it. If it does not find a PIA, then it creates an interoperability assembly that contains local interoperability classes for each class in the COM library. For more information, see [COM Interoperability in .NET Framework Applications](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/com-interop/com-interoperability-in-net-framework-applications.md).  \n  \n You should generally use strongly bound objects and primary interop assemblies whenever possible. The examples below use the `CreateObject` function with Microsoft Office objects for demonstration purposes only. However, these objects are easier to use and more reliable when used with the appropriate primary interop assembly.  \n  \n## Creating an Object on a Remote Computer  \n You can create an object on a remote networked computer by passing the name of the computer to the `ServerName` argument of the `CreateObject` function. That name is the same as the Machine Name portion of a share name: for a share named \"\\\\\\MyServer\\Public,\" `ServerName` is \"MyServer.\"  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Refer to COM documentation (see Microsoft Developer Network) for additional information on making an application accessible on a remote networked computer. You may need to add a registry key for your application.  \n  \n The following code returns the version number of an instance of Excel running on a remote computer named `MyServer`:  \n  \n```vb  \nSub CreateRemoteExcelObj()  \n    Dim xlApp As Object  \n    ' Replace string \"\\\\MyServer\" with name of the remote computer.  \n    xlApp = CreateObject(\"Excel.Application\", \"\\\\MyServer\")  \n    MsgBox(xlApp.Version)  \nEnd Sub  \n```  \n  \n If the remote server name is incorrect, or if it is unavailable, a run-time error occurs.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Use `CreateObject` when there is no current instance of the object. If an instance of the object is already running, a new instance is started, and an object of the specified type is created. To use the current instance, or to start the application and have it load a file, use the `GetObject` function. If an object has registered itself as a single-instance object, only one instance of the object is created, no matter how many times `CreateObject` is executed.  \n  \n## Creating Framework Objects  \n You can use the `CreateObject` function only to create a COM object. While there is no exact equivalent mechanism for creating a .NET Framework object, the <xref:System.Activator> in the <xref:System> namespace contains methods to create local or remote objects. In particular, the <xref:System.Activator.CreateInstance%2A> method or the <xref:System.Activator.CreateInstanceFrom%2A> method might be useful.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The `CreateObject` function requires unmanaged code permission, which might affect its execution in partial-trust situations.

The following example illustrates this.  \n  \n```vb  \nDim CADObject As Object  \nCADObject = GetObject(\"C:\\CAD\\schema.cad\")  \n```  \n  \n When this code runs, the application associated with the specified `PathName` is started and the object in the specified file is activated.  \n  \n## Default Cases  \n If `PathName` is a zero-length string (`\"\"`), `GetObject` returns a new object instance of the specified class type. If the `PathName` argument is omitted, `GetObject` returns a currently active object of the class type specified in `Class`. If no object of the specified type exists, an error occurs.  \n  \n## Accessing a Subobject  \n Some applications allow you to activate a subobject associated with a file. To do this, add an exclamation point (`!`) to the end of the file name and follow it with a string that identifies the part of the file you want to activate. For information on how to create this string, see the documentation for the application that created the object.  \n  \n For example, in a drawing application you might have multiple layers to a drawing stored in a file. You could use the following code to activate a layer within a drawing called `schema.cad`.  \n  \n```vb  \nlayerObject = GetObject(\"C:\\CAD\\schema.cad!Layer3\")  \n```  \n  \n## Specifying a Class  \n If you do not specify the object's `Class`, Automation determines the application to start and the object to activate, based on the file name you provide. Some files, however, can support more than one class of object. For example, a drawing might support three different types of objects: an `Application` object, a `Drawing` object, and a `Toolbar` object, all of which are part of the same file. To specify which object in a file you want to activate, use the optional `Class` argument. The following example illustrates this.  \n  \n```vb  \nDim drawObj As Object  \ndrawObj = GetObject(\"C:\\Drawings\\sample.drw\", \"Figment.Drawing\")  \n```  \n  \n In the preceding example, `Figment` is the name of a drawing application and `Drawing` is one of the object types it supports.  \n  \n## Using the Object  \n Once an object is activated, you refer to it in code using the object variable you declared. In the preceding example, you access properties and methods of the new object using the object variable `drawObj`. The following example illustrates this.  \n  \n```vb  \ndrawObj.Line(9, 90)  \ndrawObj.InsertText(9, 100, \"Hello, world.\")  \ndrawObj.SaveAs(\"C:\\Drawings\\sample.drw\")  \n```  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Use the `GetObject` function when there is a current instance of the object or if you want to create the object with a file loaded. If there is no current instance, and you do not want the object started with a file loaded, use the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Interaction.CreateObject%2A> function.  \n>   \n>  If an object has registered itself as an ActiveX single-instance object, only one instance of the object is created, no matter how many times `CreateObject` is called. With a single-instance object, `GetObject` always returns the same instance when called with the zero-length string (`\"\"`) syntax, and it causes an error if the `PathName` argument is omitted. You cannot use `GetObject` to obtain a reference to a class created with Visual Basic.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The `GetObject` function requires unmanaged code permission, which might affect its execution in partial-trust situations.

If you set `Wait` to `True` and the program finishes before the timeout expires, `Shell` returns zero. If the timeout expires, or if you omit `Wait` or set it to `False`, `Shell` returns the process ID of the program. The process ID is a unique number that identifies the running program.  \n  \n## Failure to Start  \n If the `Shell` function cannot start the named program, a <xref:System.IO.FileNotFoundException> error occurs. This can happen, for example, when you attempt to run a 16-bit program, such as `command.com`, from an application using <xref:System.Windows.Forms?displayProperty=fullName>. For a workaround, you can run a 32-bit program that calls the desired 16-bit program. In the case of `command.com`, you can run `cmd.exe` as an alternative.  \n  \n## Waiting for Completion  \n By default, the `Shell` function runs the program asynchronously. This means that a program started with the `Shell` function might not finish executing before the statements following the `Shell` function are executed. If you want to wait for the program to finish before you continue, set `Wait` to `True`.  \n  \n## Determining the Exit Code  \n A process can return an *exit code* when it terminates. However, you cannot use `Shell` to retrieve this exit code, because `Shell` returns zero if it waits for termination, and also because the process runs in a different object from `Shell`.  \n  \n To retrieve the exit code from a process, you must write your own code to initiate the process and wait for termination. The following example shows how to initiate a process, wait for it to terminate, and retrieve its exit code.  \n  \n```vb  \nDim procID As Integer  \nDim newProc As Diagnostics.Process  \nnewProc = Diagnostics.Process.Start(\"C:\\WINDOWS\\NOTEPAD.EXE\")  \nprocID = newProc.Id  \nnewProc.WaitForExit()  \nDim procEC As Integer = -1  \nIf newProc.HasExited Then  \n    procEC = newProc.ExitCode  \nEnd If  \nMsgBox(\"Process with ID \" & CStr(ProcID) & _  \n    \" terminated with exit code \" & CStr(procEC))  \n```  \n  \n## Protecting the File Specification  \n You should always enclose the entire path and file specification in quotation marks, as the following example shows.  \n  \n```vb  \nID = Shell(\"\"\"C:\\Program Files\\display.exe\"\" -a -q\", , True, 100000)  \n```  \n  \n Each pair of adjacent double quotation marks (`\" \"`) within the string literal is interpreted as one double quotation character in the string. Therefore, the preceding example presents the following string to the `Shell` function:  \n  \n```  \n\"C:\\Program Files\\display.exe\" -a -q  \n```  \n  \n If you did not have the path enclosed in quotation marks, Windows would look for a file called `Program.exe` in the C:\\ directory, instead of `display.exe` in the C:\\Program Files directory.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  If you do not enclose the path and file specification in quotation marks, there is a security risk if the file name or a path node contains spaces. In the preceding example, the path node `\\Program Files` includes a space. If the specification were not inside quotation marks and a program named `Program.exe` had been installed in C:\\\\, for example by illicit tampering, Windows would execute it instead of `display.exe`.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The `Shell` function requires unmanaged code permission, which might affect its execution in partial-trust situations.

Declaring an object variable with the `As Object` clause creates a variable that can contain a reference to any type of object. However, access to the object through that variable is *late-bound*, that is, the binding occurs when your program runs. There are many reasons you should avoid late binding, including slower application performance.  \\n  \\n You can create an object variable that results in early binding—that is, binding when the program is compiled. To do so, add a reference to the type library for your object from the **COM** tab of the **Add Reference** dialog box on the **Project** menu. Then declare the object variable of the specific type of your object. In most cases, it is more efficient to use the `Dim` statement and a primary interop assembly to create objects than it is to use the `CreateObject` function.  \\n  \\n## Interacting with Unmanaged Code  \\n Another issue is that COM objects use unmanaged code — code without the benefit of the common language runtime. There is a fair degree of complexity involved in mixing the managed code of Visual Basic with unmanaged code from COM. When you add a reference to a COM object, Visual Basic searches for a primary interop assembly (PIA) for that library; if it finds one, then it uses it. If it does not find a PIA, then it creates an interoperability assembly that contains local interoperability classes for each class in the COM library. For more information, see [COM Interoperability in .NET Framework Applications](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/com-interop/com-interoperability-in-net-framework-applications.md).  \\n  \\n You should generally use strongly bound objects and primary interop assemblies whenever possible. The examples below use the `CreateObject` function with Microsoft Office objects for demonstration purposes only. However, these objects are easier to use and more reliable when used with the appropriate primary interop assembly.  \\n  \\n## Creating an Object on a Remote Computer  \\n You can create an object on a remote networked computer by passing the name of the computer to the `ServerName` argument of the `CreateObject` function. That name is the same as the Machine Name portion of a share name: for a share named \\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\MyServer\\\\Public,\\\" `ServerName` is \\\"MyServer.\\\"  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  Refer to COM documentation (see Microsoft Developer Network) for additional information on making an application accessible on a remote networked computer. You may need to add a registry key for your application.  \\n  \\n The following code returns the version number of an instance of Excel running on a remote computer named `MyServer`:  \\n  \\n```vb  \\nSub CreateRemoteExcelObj()  \\n    Dim xlApp As Object  \\n    ' Replace string \\\"\\\\\\\\MyServer\\\" with name of the remote computer.  \\n    xlApp = CreateObject(\\\"Excel.Application\\\", \\\"\\\\\\\\MyServer\\\")  \\n    MsgBox(xlApp.Version)  \\nEnd Sub  \\n```  \\n  \\n If the remote server name is incorrect, or if it is unavailable, a run-time error occurs.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  Use `CreateObject` when there is no current instance of the object. If an instance of the object is already running, a new instance is started, and an object of the specified type is created. To use the current instance, or to start the application and have it load a file, use the `GetObject` function. If an object has registered itself as a single-instance object, only one instance of the object is created, no matter how many times `CreateObject` is executed.  \\n  \\n## Creating Framework Objects  \\n You can use the `CreateObject` function only to create a COM object. While there is no exact equivalent mechanism for creating a .NET Framework object, the <xref:System.Activator> in the <xref:System> namespace contains methods to create local or remote objects. In particular, the <xref:System.Activator.CreateInstance%2A> method or the <xref:System.Activator.CreateInstanceFrom%2A> method might be useful.  \\n  \\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\n>  The `CreateObject` function requires unmanaged code permission, which might affect its execution in partial-trust situations. For more information, see <xref:System.Security.Permissions.SecurityPermission> and [Code Access Permissions](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/e5ae402f-6dda-4732-bbe8-77296630f675).\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following example uses the `CreateObject` function to create a Microsoft Excel worksheet and saves the worksheet to a file. To use this example, Excel must be installed on the computer where this program runs. Also, you must add a reference to the type library from the **COM** tab of the **Add Reference** dialog box on the **Project** menu.

The following example illustrates this.  \\n  \\n```vb  \\nDim CADObject As Object  \\nCADObject = GetObject(\\\"C:\\\\CAD\\\\schema.cad\\\")  \\n```  \\n  \\n When this code runs, the application associated with the specified `PathName` is started and the object in the specified file is activated.  \\n  \\n## Default Cases  \\n If `PathName` is a zero-length string (`\\\"\\\"`), `GetObject` returns a new object instance of the specified class type. If the `PathName` argument is omitted, `GetObject` returns a currently active object of the class type specified in `Class`. If no object of the specified type exists, an error occurs.  \\n  \\n## Accessing a Subobject  \\n Some applications allow you to activate a subobject associated with a file. To do this, add an exclamation point (`!`) to the end of the file name and follow it with a string that identifies the part of the file you want to activate. For information on how to create this string, see the documentation for the application that created the object.  \\n  \\n For example, in a drawing application you might have multiple layers to a drawing stored in a file. You could use the following code to activate a layer within a drawing called `schema.cad`.  \\n  \\n```vb  \\nlayerObject = GetObject(\\\"C:\\\\CAD\\\\schema.cad!Layer3\\\")  \\n```  \\n  \\n## Specifying a Class  \\n If you do not specify the object's `Class`, Automation determines the application to start and the object to activate, based on the file name you provide. Some files, however, can support more than one class of object. For example, a drawing might support three different types of objects: an `Application` object, a `Drawing` object, and a `Toolbar` object, all of which are part of the same file. To specify which object in a file you want to activate, use the optional `Class` argument. The following example illustrates this.  \\n  \\n```vb  \\nDim drawObj As Object  \\ndrawObj = GetObject(\\\"C:\\\\Drawings\\\\sample.drw\\\", \\\"Figment.Drawing\\\")  \\n```  \\n  \\n In the preceding example, `Figment` is the name of a drawing application and `Drawing` is one of the object types it supports.  \\n  \\n## Using the Object  \\n Once an object is activated, you refer to it in code using the object variable you declared. In the preceding example, you access properties and methods of the new object using the object variable `drawObj`. The following example illustrates this.  \\n  \\n```vb  \\ndrawObj.Line(9, 90)  \\ndrawObj.InsertText(9, 100, \\\"Hello, world.\\\")  \\ndrawObj.SaveAs(\\\"C:\\\\Drawings\\\\sample.drw\\\")  \\n```  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  Use the `GetObject` function when there is a current instance of the object or if you want to create the object with a file loaded. If there is no current instance, and you do not want the object started with a file loaded, use the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Interaction.CreateObject%2A> function.  \\n>   \\n>  If an object has registered itself as an ActiveX single-instance object, only one instance of the object is created, no matter how many times `CreateObject` is called. With a single-instance object, `GetObject` always returns the same instance when called with the zero-length string (`\\\"\\\"`) syntax, and it causes an error if the `PathName` argument is omitted. You cannot use `GetObject` to obtain a reference to a class created with Visual Basic.  \\n  \\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\n>  The `GetObject` function requires unmanaged code permission, which might affect its execution in partial-trust situations. For more information, see <xref:System.Security.Permissions.SecurityPermission> and [Code Access Permissions](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/e5ae402f-6dda-4732-bbe8-77296630f675).\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following example uses the `GetObject` function to obtain a reference to a specific Microsoft Excel worksheet (`excelObj`). It uses the worksheet's `Application` property to make Excel visible, to close it, and to perform other actions. Using two API calls, the `detectExcel` procedure looks for Excel, and if it is running, enters it in the Running Object table. The first call to `GetObject` causes an error if Excel is not already running, which in this example causes the `excelWasNotRunning` flag to be set to `True`. The second call to `GetObject` specifies a file to open. If Excel is not already running, the second call starts it and returns a reference to the worksheet represented by the specified file, `test.xls`. The file must exist in the specified location; otherwise, Visual Basic throws a <xref:System.IO.FileNotFoundException>. Next, the example code makes both Excel and the window containing the specified worksheet visible.  \\n  \\n This example requires `Option Strict Off` because it uses late binding, where objects are assigned to variables of type `Object`. You can specify `Option Strict On` and declare objects of specific object types if you add a reference to the Excel type library from the **COM** tab of the **Add Reference** dialog box of the **Project** menu in Visual Studio.  \\n  \\n [!code-vb[VbVbalrExcelObject#2](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrExcelObject/VB/Class1.vb#2)]  \\n  \\n [!code-vb[VbVbalrExcelObject#4](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrExcelObject/VB/Class1.vb#4)]  \\n  \\n [!code-vb[VbVbalrExcelObject#5](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrExcelObject/VB/Class1.vb#5)]  \\n  \\n When you call the `getExcel` function, a check is made to see if Excel is already running.

The first range begins at `Start`, and the last range ends at `Stop`. The `Partition` function then identifies which range contains `Number` and returns a string describing that range. The range is represented in the string as \\\"*lowervalue*:*uppervalue*\\\", where the low end of the range (*lowervalue*) is separated from the high end (*uppervalue*) by a colon (:).  \\n  \\n If necessary, the `Partition` function inserts leading spaces before *lowervalue* and *uppervalue* so that they both have the same number of characters as the string representation of the value (`Stop` + 1). This ensures that if you use the output of the `Partition` function with several values of `Number`, the resulting text will be handled properly during any subsequent sort operation.  \\n  \\n The following table shows some sample strings for ranges calculated using three sets of `Start`, `Stop`, and `Interval`. The \\\"First range\\\" and \\\"Last range\\\" columns show the lowest and highest ranges possible given the values of `Start` and `Stop`. The \\\"Before first range\\\" and \\\"After last range\\\" columns show the strings returned for values of `Number` less than `Start` and greater than `Stop`, respectively.  \\n  \\n|`Start`|`Stop`|`Interval`|Before first range|First range|Last range|After last range|  \\n|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|  \\n|0|99|5|\\\"   : -1\\\"|\\\"  0:  4\\\"|\\\" 95: 99\\\"|\\\"100:   \\\"|  \\n|20|199|10|\\\"   : 19\\\"|\\\" 20: 29\\\"|\\\"190:199\\\"|\\\"200:   \\\"|  \\n|100|1010|20|\\\"    : 99\\\"|\\\" 100: 119\\\"|\\\"1000:1010\\\"|\\\"1011:    \\\"|  \\n  \\n In the preceding table, the third line shows the result when `Start` and `Stop` define a set of numbers that cannot be evenly divided by `Interval`. The last range ends at `Stop`, making it only 11 numbers long, even though `Interval` is 20.  \\n  \\n If `Interval` is 1, the range is \\\"`Number`:`Number`\\\", regardless of the `Start` and `Stop` arguments. For example, if `Number` is 267, `Stop` is 1000, and `Interval` is 1, `Partition` returns \\\" 267: 267\\\".  \\n  \\n `Partition` can be useful when constructing database queries. You can create a SELECT query that shows how many orders occur within various value ranges, for example with invoice values from 1 to 1000, 1001 to 2000, and so on.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following example sets up a series of ranges for decades from 1950 through 2049.

If you set `Wait` to `True` and the program finishes before the timeout expires, `Shell` returns zero. If the timeout expires, or if you omit `Wait` or set it to `False`, `Shell` returns the process ID of the program. The process ID is a unique number that identifies the running program.  \\n  \\n## Failure to Start  \\n If the `Shell` function cannot start the named program, a <xref:System.IO.FileNotFoundException> error occurs. This can happen, for example, when you attempt to run a 16-bit program, such as `command.com`, from an application using <xref:System.Windows.Forms?displayProperty=fullName>. For a workaround, you can run a 32-bit program that calls the desired 16-bit program. In the case of `command.com`, you can run `cmd.exe` as an alternative.  \\n  \\n## Waiting for Completion  \\n By default, the `Shell` function runs the program asynchronously. This means that a program started with the `Shell` function might not finish executing before the statements following the `Shell` function are executed. If you want to wait for the program to finish before you continue, set `Wait` to `True`.  \\n  \\n## Determining the Exit Code  \\n A process can return an *exit code* when it terminates. However, you cannot use `Shell` to retrieve this exit code, because `Shell` returns zero if it waits for termination, and also because the process runs in a different object from `Shell`.  \\n  \\n To retrieve the exit code from a process, you must write your own code to initiate the process and wait for termination. The following example shows how to initiate a process, wait for it to terminate, and retrieve its exit code.  \\n  \\n```vb  \\nDim procID As Integer  \\nDim newProc As Diagnostics.Process  \\nnewProc = Diagnostics.Process.Start(\\\"C:\\\\WINDOWS\\\\NOTEPAD.EXE\\\")  \\nprocID = newProc.Id  \\nnewProc.WaitForExit()  \\nDim procEC As Integer = -1  \\nIf newProc.HasExited Then  \\n    procEC = newProc.ExitCode  \\nEnd If  \\nMsgBox(\\\"Process with ID \\\" & CStr(ProcID) & _  \\n    \\\" terminated with exit code \\\" & CStr(procEC))  \\n```  \\n  \\n## Protecting the File Specification  \\n You should always enclose the entire path and file specification in quotation marks, as the following example shows.  \\n  \\n```vb  \\nID = Shell(\\\"\\\"\\\"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\display.exe\\\"\\\" -a -q\\\", , True, 100000)  \\n```  \\n  \\n Each pair of adjacent double quotation marks (`\\\" \\\"`) within the string literal is interpreted as one double quotation character in the string. Therefore, the preceding example presents the following string to the `Shell` function:  \\n  \\n```  \\n\\\"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\display.exe\\\" -a -q  \\n```  \\n  \\n If you did not have the path enclosed in quotation marks, Windows would look for a file called `Program.exe` in the C:\\\\ directory, instead of `display.exe` in the C:\\\\Program Files directory.  \\n  \\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\n>  If you do not enclose the path and file specification in quotation marks, there is a security risk if the file name or a path node contains spaces. In the preceding example, the path node `\\\\Program Files` includes a space. If the specification were not inside quotation marks and a program named `Program.exe` had been installed in C:\\\\\\\\, for example by illicit tampering, Windows would execute it instead of `display.exe`.  \\n  \\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\n>  The `Shell` function requires unmanaged code permission, which might affect its execution in partial-trust situations.
