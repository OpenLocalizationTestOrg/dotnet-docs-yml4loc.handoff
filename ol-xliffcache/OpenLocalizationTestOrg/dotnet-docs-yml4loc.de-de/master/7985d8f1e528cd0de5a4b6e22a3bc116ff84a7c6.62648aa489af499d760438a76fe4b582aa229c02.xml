This class cannot be inherited.\n  remarks: \"A buffer is a block of bytes in memory used to cache data, thereby reducing the number of calls to the operating system. Buffers improve read and write performance. A buffer can be used for either reading or writing, but never both simultaneously. The <xref:System.IO.BufferedStream.Read%2A> and <xref:System.IO.BufferedStream.Write%2A> methods of `BufferedStream` automatically maintain the buffer.  \\n  \\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\n>  This type implements the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface. When you have finished using the type, you should dispose of it either directly or indirectly. To dispose of the type directly, call its <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method in a `try`/`catch` block. To dispose of it indirectly, use a language construct such as `using` (in C#) or `Using` (in Visual Basic). For more information, see the \\\"Using an Object that Implements IDisposable\\\" section in the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface topic.  \\n  \\n `BufferedStream` can be composed around certain types of streams. It provides implementations for reading and writing bytes to an underlying data source or repository. Use <xref:System.IO.BinaryReader> and <xref:System.IO.BinaryWriter> for reading and writing other data types. `BufferedStream` is designed to prevent the buffer from slowing down input and output when the buffer is not needed. If you always read and write for sizes greater than the internal buffer size, then `BufferedStream` might not even allocate the internal buffer. `BufferedStream` also buffers reads and writes in a shared buffer. It is assumed that you will almost always be doing a series of reads or writes, but rarely alternate between the two of them.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code examples show how to use the `BufferedStream` class over the `NetworkStream` class to increase the performance of certain I/O operations. Start the server on a remote computer before starting the client. Specify the remote computer name as a command-line argument when starting the client.
