  summary: Represents the method that will handle the <xref href="System.Web.UI.Design.IControlDesignerView.ViewEvent"></xref> event that is raised by visual design tools, such as Visual Studio 2005, implementing the <xref href="System.Web.UI.Design.IControlDesignerView"></xref> interface. This class cannot be inherited.
  remarks: "When you create a <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ViewEventHandler> delegate, you identify the method that will handle the event. To associate the event with your event handler, add an instance of the delegate to the event. The event handler is called whenever the event occurs, unless you remove the delegate. For more information about event-handler delegates, see [NIB: Events and Delegates](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/d98fd58b-fa4f-4598-8378-addf4355a115).  \n  \n The <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.IControlDesignerView.ViewEvent> event is raised by the designer host for certain actions on a control on the design surface. The <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.IControlDesignerView.ViewEvent> event is handled by a <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ViewEventHandler> delegate method, which takes a <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ViewEventArgs> object as a parameter.  \n  \n Typically, control designer classes do not directly implement or assign a <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ViewEventHandler> delegate. The <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ControlDesigner> base class supplies a default delegate for the <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.IControlDesignerView.ViewEvent> event. Custom control designers override the <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ControlDesigner.OnClick%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ControlDesigner.OnPaint%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.TemplatedControlDesigner.OnTemplateModeChanged%2A> methods to process those events for the control on the design surface. The <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ControlDesigner.Initialize%2A> method sets the default event delegate for the <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.IControlDesignerView.ViewEvent> delegate."
