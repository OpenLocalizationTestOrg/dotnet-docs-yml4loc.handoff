A method is compiled on the main application thread if the application needs to call it before the background thread has compiled it.  \\n  \\n The code that performs the recording tracks the rate at which methods are compiled, including methods that are compiled on both the background thread and on the main thread. When the rate falls below a predetermined level, recording stops. Recording also stops if the rate of JIT compilation exceeds a predetermined upper limit.  \\n  \\n If the <xref:System.Runtime.ProfileOptimization.SetProfileRoot%2A> method has not been called for the current application domain, or if the computer does not have multiple cores, the <xref:System.Runtime.ProfileOptimization.StartProfile%2A> method has no effect.\"\n  syntax:\n    content: >-\n      [System.Security.SecurityCritical]\n\n      public static void StartProfile (string profile);\n    parameters:\n    - id: profile\n      type: System.String\n      description: The file name of the profile to use.\n  overload: System.Runtime.ProfileOptimization.StartProfile*\n  exceptions: []\n  attributes:\n  - type: System.Security.SecurityCriticalAttribute\n  version:\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  monikers:\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  content_git_url: https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/xml/System.Runtime/ProfileOptimization.xml\n  ms.technology:\n  - dotnet-standard\n  author: rpetrusha\n  ms.author: ronpet\n  manager: wpickett\nreferences:\n- uid: System.Object\n  parent: System\n  isExternal: false\n  name: Object\n  nameWithType: Object\n  fullName: System.Object\n- uid: System.Runtime.ProfileOptimization.SetProfileRoot(System.String)\n  parent: System.Runtime.ProfileOptimization\n  isExternal: false\n  name: SetProfileRoot(String)\n  nameWithType: ProfileOptimization.SetProfileRoot(String)\n  fullName: ProfileOptimization.SetProfileRoot(String)\n- uid: System.String\n  parent: System\n  isExternal: false\n  name: String\n  nameWithType: String\n  fullName: System.String\n- uid: System.Runtime.ProfileOptimization.StartProfile(System.String)\n  parent: System.Runtime.ProfileOptimization\n  isExternal: false\n  name: StartProfile(String)\n  nameWithType: ProfileOptimization.StartProfile(String)\n  fullName: ProfileOptimization.StartProfile(String)\n- uid: System.Runtime.ProfileOptimization.SetProfileRoot*\n  parent: System.Runtime.ProfileOptimization\n  isExternal: false\n  name: SetProfileRoot\n  nameWithType: ProfileOptimization.SetProfileRoot\n  fullName: ProfileOptimization.SetProfileRoot\n  monikers:\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  content_git_url: https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/xml/System.Runtime/ProfileOptimization.xml\n- uid: System.Runtime.ProfileOptimization.StartProfile*\n  parent: System.Runtime.ProfileOptimization\n  isExternal: false\n  name: StartProfile\n  nameWithType: ProfileOptimization.StartProfile\n  fullName: ProfileOptimization.StartProfile\n  monikers:\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  content_git_url: https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/xml/System.Runtime/ProfileOptimization.xml\n- uid: System.Object.Equals(System.Object)\n  parent: System.Object\n  isExternal: false\n  name: Equals(Object)\n  nameWithType: Object.Equals(Object)\n  fullName: Object.Equals(Object)\n- uid: System.Object.Equals(System.Object,System.Object)\n  parent: System.Object\n  isExternal: false\n  name: Equals(Object, Object)\n  nameWithType: Object.Equals(Object, Object)\n  fullName: Object.Equals(Object, Object)\n- uid: System.Object.GetHashCode\n  parent: System.Object\n  isExternal: false\n  name: GetHashCode()\n  nameWithType: Object.GetHashCode()\n  fullName: Object.GetHashCode()\n- uid: System.Object.GetType\n  parent: System.Object\n  isExternal: false\n  name: GetType()\n  nameWithType: Object.GetType()\n  fullName: Object.GetType()\n- uid: System.Object.MemberwiseClone\n  parent: System.Object\n  isExternal: false\n  name: MemberwiseClone()\n  nameWithType: Object.MemberwiseClone()\n  fullName: Object.MemberwiseClone()\n- uid: System.Object.ReferenceEquals(System.Object,System.Object)\n  parent: System.Object\n  isExternal: false\n  name: ReferenceEquals(Object, Object)\n  nameWithType: Object.ReferenceEquals(Object, Object)\n  fullName: Object.ReferenceEquals(Object, Object)\n- uid: System.Object.ToString\n  parent: System.Object\n  isExternal: false\n  name: ToString()\n  nameWithType: Object.ToString()\n  fullName: Object.ToString()\n"}
