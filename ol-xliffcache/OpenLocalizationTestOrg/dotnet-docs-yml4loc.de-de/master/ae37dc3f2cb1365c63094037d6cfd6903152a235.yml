  summary: Enumerates values of subset matching mode.
  remarks: "In System.Speech, you can construct a grammar that successfully recognizes a phrase even though only a subset of its contents is found in the audio input.  \n  \n By default, a recognition engine requires an exact match against an entire phrase. The recognition engine can also match partial phrases according to parameters defined by a <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SubsetMatchingMode> member used as an argument to the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.GrammarBuilder.%23ctor%2A> or <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SrgsGrammar.SrgsSubset.%23ctor%2A> constructors, or the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.GrammarBuilder.Append%2A> method.  \n  \n The following illustrates how each of the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SubsetMatchingMode> members affects recognition when used in a grammar that contains the phrase \"a car the truck a boat that plane\".  \n  \n **OrderedSubset**  \n  \n This mode indicates that a subset of the phrase will be used to successfully recognize the entire phrase if the following are true:  \n  \n-   One or more words in the phrase are recognized in the audio input.  \n  \n-   The relative order of those recognized words is the same as in the phrase.  \n  \n-   Matched words may consist of only prepositions and articles.  \n  \n Adding the phrase \"a car the truck a boat that plane\" to a grammar using OrderedSubset mode produces the following result on recognition:  \n  \n|**Input Phrase**|**Result**|  \n|----------------------|----------------|  \n|\"a car the truck a boat that plane\"|The entire phrase \"a car the truck a boat that plane\" is recognized.|  \n|\"a car the truck a boat\"|The entire phrase \"a car the truck a boat that plane\" is recognized.|  \n|\"a car the that plane\"|The entire phrase \"a car the truck a boat that plane\" is recognized.

  example:
  - "Below is a test routine which generates four <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.Grammar> objects, using the same phrase, for each of the `SubsetMatchingModes`. These <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.Grammar> objects can then be tested.  \n  \n```  \nprivate void CreateSubsetMatchTest()   \n{  \n  foreach ( System.Speech.Recognition.SubsetMatchingMode mode   \n              in Enum.GetValues(typeof(System.Speech.Recognition.SubsetMatchingMode)))  \n  {  \n    GrammarBuilder gb = new GrammarBuilder(\"a car the truck a boat that plane\",mode);  \n    Grammar grammar = new Grammar(gb);  \n    grammar.Name = mode.ToString();  \n    grammar.Enabled=true;  \n    _recognizer.LoadGrammar(grammar);  \n  }  \n}  \n```"
