A custom setting provider should resolve attributes applied to settings properties in the following manner:  \\n  \\n1.  If the provider can fulfill the request implied by the attribute, obviously it should do so.  \\n  \\n2.  If the provider cannot fulfill the request, it should ignore it silently.  \\n  \\n3.  If two or more properties conflict; for example, a property being decorated with both <xref:System.Configuration.ApplicationScopedSettingAttribute> and <xref:System.Configuration.UserScopedSettingAttribute>; the provider should throw a <xref:System.Configuration.ConfigurationException>.\"\n  syntax:\n    content: 'public abstract class SettingsProvider : System.Configuration.Provider.ProviderBase'\n  inheritance:\n  - System.Object\n  - System.Configuration.Provider.ProviderBase\n  derivedClasses:\n  - System.Configuration.LocalFileSettingsProvider\n  - System.Web.ClientServices.Providers.ClientSettingsProvider\n  - System.Web.Profile.ProfileProvider\n  implements: []\n  inheritedMembers:\n  - System.Configuration.Provider.ProviderBase.Description\n  - System.Configuration.Provider.ProviderBase.Initialize(System.String,System.Collections.Specialized.NameValueCollection)\n  - System.Configuration.Provider.ProviderBase.Name\n  - System.Object.Equals(System.Object)\n  - System.Object.Equals(System.Object,System.Object)\n  - System.Object.GetHashCode\n  - System.Object.GetType\n  - System.Object.MemberwiseClone\n  - System.Object.ReferenceEquals(System.Object,System.Object)\n  - System.Object.ToString\n  version:\n  - netcore-2.0\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  - xamarinmac-3.0\n  monikers:\n  - netcore-2.0\n  - netframework-4.5.1\n  - netframework-4.5.2\n  - netframework-4.5\n  - netframework-4.6.1\n  - netframework-4.6.2\n  - netframework-4.6\n  - netframework-4.7\n  - xamarinmac-3.0\n  content_git_url: https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/xml/System.Configuration/SettingsProvider.xml\n  ms.technology:\n  - dotnet-standard\n  author: stevehoag\n  ms.author: shoag\n  manager: wpickett\n- uid: System.Configuration.SettingsProvider.#ctor\n  commentId: M:System.Configuration.SettingsProvider.#ctor\n  id: '#ctor'\n  parent: System.Configuration.SettingsProvider\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  name: SettingsProvider()\n  nameWithType: SettingsProvider.SettingsProvider()\n  fullName: SettingsProvider.SettingsProvider()\n  type: Constructor\n  assemblies:\n  - System\n  - System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager\n  namespace: System.Configuration\n  summary: Initializes an instance of the <xref href=\"System.Configuration.SettingsProvider\"></xref> class.\n  remarks: \"This is this default protected constructor for this abstract class.
