For a binding property path, the character that identifies a \"step\" is a dot (.). Indexer references (including multiple indexers, and type differentiation) are also supported. For more details on the syntax of the string as specifically used by the <xref:System.Windows.Data.Binding> object, see <xref:System.Windows.Data.Binding.Path%2A?displayProperty=fullName>. A property used as a binding source need not be a dependency property. If the binding updates two-way, the property source must be read-write. Also note that the binding target does have to be a dependency property. For details, see [Data Binding Overview](~/docs/framework/wpf/data/data-binding-overview.md).  \n  \n If using this <xref:System.Windows.PropertyPath> in target mode for a single-step path for a storyboard target, <xref:System.Windows.PropertyPath> is a string that is a *typeName*.*propertyName* qualified dependency property name string.  \n  \n If using this <xref:System.Windows.PropertyPath> for a complex path for a storyboard target, <xref:System.Windows.PropertyPath.Path%2A> is a tokenized string format that describes the relationships of the various objects given in the <xref:System.Windows.PropertyPath.PathParameters%2A>.  \n  \n-   Each item in the array is specified in this format by the array index for the item enclosed in parentheses. For example, to specify the first item in the array, the string token is `(0)`.  \n  \n-   Relationships between items (\"steps\" in the path) are specified by a dot (.). The property forward of the dot is the first step in the path, the property after is the second step, and so on (you can specify steps beyond two). The last step in the chain always represents the property being animated.  \n  \n-   Items within collection properties are accessed with an indexer syntax, with the index within square brackets ([ and ]). The indexer is additive to the token representing the property. For example, the following is a two-step path, with the token combination in the first step specifying the second item from within the collection of that property: `(0)[1].(1)` . You cannot use an indexer on the last property in the chain; you cannot animate the actual collection position, you must animate a property on that object.  \n  \n The path string for a <xref:System.Windows.PropertyPath> is typically established through the constructors: the <xref:System.Windows.PropertyPath.%23ctor%28System.Object%29> signature for bindings or single-step storyboard targets, the <xref:System.Windows.PropertyPath.%23ctor%28System.String%2CSystem.Object%5B%5D%29> signature for multi-step storyboard targets.  \n  \n **XAML:** When you use a <xref:System.Windows.PropertyPath> to describe a property reference in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)], as an attribute value, the string that you specify is first handled by a type converter (<xref:System.Windows.PropertyPathConverter>). This type converter then processes the string and based on its syntax will call one of the <xref:System.Windows.PropertyPath> constructor signatures. This indirection through the type converter handling an attribute value is generally how you use <xref:System.Windows.PropertyPath> in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)], rather than declaring a <xref:System.Windows.PropertyPath> object element and then applying specific values to attributes such as <xref:System.Windows.PropertyPath.Path%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.PropertyPath.PathParameters%2A>.
