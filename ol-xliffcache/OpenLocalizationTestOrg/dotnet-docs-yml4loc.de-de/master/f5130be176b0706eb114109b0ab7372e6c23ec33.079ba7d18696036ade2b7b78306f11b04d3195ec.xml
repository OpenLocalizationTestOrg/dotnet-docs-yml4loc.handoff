The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.CatalogIconImageUrl%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.ChromeState%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.ChromeType%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.Description%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.Height%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.HelpUrl%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.Hidden%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.Title%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.TitleIconImageUrl%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.TitleUrl%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.Width%2A> properties determine the size, visibility, appearance, and supporting content (such as a title and a description) for a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control.  \n  \n The relationship of a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control to its context within the Web Parts control set is determined by properties such as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.WebPartManager%2A>, which holds a reference to the control's associated <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> object, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.Zone%2A>, which references the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> that contains the control. There can be only one <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control per page, and each instance of a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control can reside within only one <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> at a time.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  A <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control can be placed outside of a zone on a Web page, but in this case it functions as a normal server control and loses nearly all Web Parts functionality.  \n  \n Several other important properties affect unique features of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AuthorizationFilter%2A> property allows developers to set an arbitrary string that can be used as a filter at run time to determine whether a control is added to the page. Used together with a feature such as role management, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AuthorizationFilter%2A> property provides a useful mechanism for creating views based on defined user roles. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.ExportMode%2A> property indicates whether, during an export, all the available property data on a control is exported, or only the non-sensitive data. This allows developers to distinguish between data that is sensitive and data that is not, for security purposes. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.WebBrowsableObject%2A> property returns a reference to an instance of a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control, so that an <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> control can edit it when the page is in edit mode. Finally, there are several properties that indicate the status of the control relative to the rest of the page. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.IsClosed%2A> property indicates whether a control is closed (and thus added to a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PageCatalogPart> object), or if it is open and available on the page. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.IsShared%2A> property indicates whether a control is a shared control (versus a user-specific control), meaning that it is visible to all users of a Web page. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.IsStandalone%2A> property indicates whether a control is currently contained in a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase>-derived zone (such as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone>). A value of `false` indicates the control is inside a zone and thus has full Web Parts functionality. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.IsStatic%2A> property indicates whether a control is static or dynamic. A static control is declared in the markup of a Web page, whereas a dynamic control is added programmatically.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> class also provides several methods that determine what happens at various points in the control's life cycle. For example, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.OnConnectModeChanged%2A> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.OnEditModeChanged%2A> methods can both be overridden in a derived class to provide programmatic control over the rendering of a control's contents during the event that corresponds to each method's name.  \n  \n Classes that derive from <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> can add <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartVerb> objects to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.Verbs%2A> collection. The verbs are rendered in a verbs menu, which appears in the title bar of a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control. <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartVerb> objects provide simple UI elements for common user actions such as hiding or minimizing the control or displaying Help.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.CreateEditorParts%2A> method creates a collection of any custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls that are associated with a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control. Developers can override this method so that it creates custom controls designed specifically to edit their <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control. The method is called when a user clicks the edit verb on a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,1125],"content":"When you create controls with Web Parts functionality, you have two basic options.

You can create custom controls that derive from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> class, or you can create or use other server controls. Existing ASP.NET controls, custom server controls, and user controls can all be given full Web Parts functionality by declaring them within (or adding them programmatically to) a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> zone control, with the result that they will be wrapped with <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart> objects at run time and treated as true <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls. For details, see the documentation for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart> class. For speed of development and maximum reuse of code, using existing server controls can be a good option. For maximum programmatic control over the behavior and Web Parts functionality of controls, creating a custom control that inherits from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> class is often the best option.  \\n  \\n The abstract <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> class inherits from the base <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.Part> control and provides the basic elements for all <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls. The class includes a common set of properties that affect the appearance of the UI. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AllowClose%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AllowConnect%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AllowEdit%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AllowHide%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AllowMinimize%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AllowZoneChange%2A> properties each specify whether the user of a Web application is permitted to interact with the part control in the way indicated by the given property name. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.CatalogIconImageUrl%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.ChromeState%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.ChromeType%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.Description%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.Height%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.HelpUrl%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.Hidden%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.Title%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.TitleIconImageUrl%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.TitleUrl%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.Width%2A> properties determine the size, visibility, appearance, and supporting content (such as a title and a description) for a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control.  \\n  \\n The relationship of a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control to its context within the Web Parts control set is determined by properties such as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.WebPartManager%2A>, which holds a reference to the control's associated <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> object, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.Zone%2A>, which references the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> that contains the control. There can be only one <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control per page, and each instance of a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control can reside within only one <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> at a time.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  A <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control can be placed outside of a zone on a Web page, but in this case it functions as a normal server control and loses nearly all Web Parts functionality.  \\n  \\n Several other important properties affect unique features of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AuthorizationFilter%2A> property allows developers to set an arbitrary string that can be used as a filter at run time to determine whether a control is added to the page. Used together with a feature such as role management, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AuthorizationFilter%2A> property provides a useful mechanism for creating views based on defined user roles. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.ExportMode%2A> property indicates whether, during an export, all the available property data on a control is exported, or only the non-sensitive data. This allows developers to distinguish between data that is sensitive and data that is not, for security purposes. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.WebBrowsableObject%2A> property returns a reference to an instance of a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control, so that an <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> control can edit it when the page is in edit mode. Finally, there are several properties that indicate the status of the control relative to the rest of the page. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.IsClosed%2A> property indicates whether a control is closed (and thus added to a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PageCatalogPart> object), or if it is open and available on the page. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.IsShared%2A> property indicates whether a control is a shared control (versus a user-specific control), meaning that it is visible to all users of a Web page. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.IsStandalone%2A> property indicates whether a control is currently contained in a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase>-derived zone (such as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone>). A value of `false` indicates the control is inside a zone and thus has full Web Parts functionality. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.IsStatic%2A> property indicates whether a control is static or dynamic. A static control is declared in the markup of a Web page, whereas a dynamic control is added programmatically.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> class also provides several methods that determine what happens at various points in the control's life cycle. For example, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.OnConnectModeChanged%2A> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.OnEditModeChanged%2A> methods can both be overridden in a derived class to provide programmatic control over the rendering of a control's contents during the event that corresponds to each method's name.  \\n  \\n Classes that derive from <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> can add <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartVerb> objects to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.Verbs%2A> collection. The verbs are rendered in a verbs menu, which appears in the title bar of a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control. <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartVerb> objects provide simple UI elements for common user actions such as hiding or minimizing the control or displaying Help.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.CreateEditorParts%2A> method creates a collection of any custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls that are associated with a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control. Developers can override this method so that it creates custom controls designed specifically to edit their <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control. The method is called when a user clicks the edit verb on a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example demonstrates how to create a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control and reference it in a Web page.  \\n  \\n The first part of the example contains the code for a custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control named `TextDisplayWebPart`. This control demonstrates how to create a simple custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control that gives you access to the features of the Web Parts control set. For the code example to run, you must compile this source code. You can compile it explicitly and put the resulting assembly in your Web site's Bin folder or the global assembly cache. Alternatively, you can put the source code in your site's App_Code folder, where it will be dynamically compiled at run time. This code example assumes that you compile the source code into an assembly, place it in a Bin subfolder of your Web application, and reference the assembly with a `Register` directive in your Web page. For a walkthrough that demonstrates both methods of compiling, see [Walkthrough: Developing and Using a Custom Web Server Control](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/6d90782a-a1a4-45a6-b2d4-cf6362b83b08).  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[WebParts_General_TextDisplayPart#2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_General_TextDisplayPart/CS/textdisplaywebpart.cs#2)]\\n [!code-vb[WebParts_General_TextDisplayPart#2](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_General_TextDisplayPart/VB/textdisplaywebpart.vb#2)]  \\n  \\n The second part of the example shows how to reference the `TextDisplayWebPart` control in an ASP.NET Web page.

For details, see <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PersonalizableAttribute>.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  To enable the export feature for a Web application that includes Web Parts controls, in the Web.config file for your application, you must add an attribute to the `<webParts>` element within the `<system.web>` section, as in the following markup.  \\n>   \\n>  `<webParts  enableExport=\\\"true\\\">`  \\n>   \\n>  `</webParts>`  \\n  \\n This property cannot be set by themes or style sheet themes.

Note that for the export code example to work, you must also update your Web.config file by adding the attribute `enableExport=\\\"true\\\"` to the `<webParts>` element, as indicated in the Remarks section.  \\n  \\n The first part of this example contains the code for a control named `TextDisplayWebPart`. This control is the same as the custom control that is found in the Example section of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> class overview, except that it adds a `Personalizable` attribute to the `TextDisplayWebPart.ContentText` property so the property can be exported. Note that the attribute declaration includes a value of `true` for the `isSensitive` parameter, meaning that the property is marked as sensitive data for export purposes. For the code example to run, you must compile this source code. You can compile it explicitly and put the resulting assembly in your Web site's Bin folder or the global assembly cache. Alternatively, you can put the source code in your site's App_Code folder, where it will be dynamically compiled at run time. This code example assumes that you compile the source code into an assembly, place it in a Bin subfolder of your Web application, and reference the assembly with a `Register` directive in your Web page. For a walkthrough that demonstrates both methods of compiling, see [Walkthrough: Developing and Using a Custom Web Server Control](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/6d90782a-a1a4-45a6-b2d4-cf6362b83b08).  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[WebParts_WebPart_ExportMode#2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_WebPart_ExportMode/CS/textdisplaywebpart.cs#2)]\\n [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPart_ExportMode#2](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_WebPart_ExportMode/VB/textdisplaywebpart.vb#2)]  \\n  \\n The second part of the example shows how to reference the `TextDisplayWebPart` control in an ASP.NET Web page.

Internet Explorer renders Web pages either in compatibility mode (backward compatible with previous browser versions) or in standards mode (determined by the presence of a `DOCTYPE` declaration in the page). For information about these modes, see the DHTML [compatMode](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=57175) property.  \\n  \\n When Internet Explorer renders a page in standards mode, under some circumstances it might not resize cells in tables, even when a cell's HTML markup is `<td height=\\\"100%\\\">`. As a result, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls and their containing zone are rendered so that the controls do not stretch to the full height of the zone.  \\n  \\n When Internet Explorer is in standard mode, controls do not render to stretch to their full height in the following cases:  \\n  \\n-   When a zone's <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.LayoutOrientation%2A> property is set to <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Orientation.Vertical> and you explicitly set the height on the zone. To enable controls to fill the full height of the zone, do not specify the height of a horizontally oriented zone.  \\n  \\n-   When a zone's <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.LayoutOrientation%2A> property is set to <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Orientation.Horizontal> and you do not explicitly set the height of the zone or of the contained controls. To enable controls to fill the full height of the zone, set the height of the zone or of the controls in a vertically oriented zone.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example demonstrates the rendering issue that affects the height of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls in a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone>.  To demonstrate this issue, you must run the page in Internet Explorer.  \\n  \\n Note that the zone's orientation is set to horizontal, and that the height of the zone and the controls within it is not set explicitly.  The result is that in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone>, the shorter <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control does not stretch to the height of the zone upon rendering.  However, if you remove the `DOCTYPE` declaration from the page and run the page again, the issue does not occur, because now the browser will not render the page in standards mode.  \\n  \\n <!-- TODO: review snippet reference [!code-csharp[WebParts_WebPart_Height#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_WebPart_Height/CS/Defaultcs.aspx#1)]  -->\\n <!-- TODO: review snippet reference [!code-vb[WebParts_WebPart_Height#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_WebPart_Height/VB/Defaultvb.aspx#1)]  -->  \\n  \\n To see how the workaround (described in the Remarks section) works, try adding a `height` attribute to the `<asp:webpartzone>` element, while keeping the `DOCTYPE` declaration in the page.  You can use the following code to add the attribute to the tag:  \\n  \\n `Height=\\\"200px\\\"`  \\n  \\n Run the page, and now both <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls stretch to fill the explicitly declared height of the zone.  \\n  \\n You can also experiment with this code example to observe the height-related rendering issue in the other scenario, which occurs when the zone's <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.LayoutOrientation%2A> is set to <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Orientation.Vertical>.  Remove the existing `LayoutOrientation` attribute and its value from the `<asp:webpartzone>` element, which will cause the zone's orientation to revert to the default vertical orientation.  Set the height attribute on the `<asp:webpartzone>` element to 200 pixels, as you did above, and run the page.  The zone's height looks too large, and the controls are not sized proportionately to the zone's height.  Now remove the height attribute and run the page again.

Usually verbs are represented in the UI as buttons, links, or menu items. By default, common Web Parts verbs appear on a drop-down verbs menu in each <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control's title bar. There are standard verbs for opening, closing, editing, and minimizing a control, and other verbs for exporting a definition for the control or loading a Help file.
