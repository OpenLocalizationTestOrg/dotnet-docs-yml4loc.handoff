When you have finished using the type, you should dispose of it either directly or indirectly. To dispose of the type directly, call its <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method in a `try`/`catch` block. To dispose of it indirectly, use a language construct such as `using` (in C#) or `Using` (in Visual Basic). For more information, see the \\\"Using an Object that Implements IDisposable\\\" section in the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface topic.  \\n  \\n A thread is a path of execution through a program. It is the smallest unit of execution that Win32 schedules. It consists of a stack, the state of the CPU registers, and an entry in the execution list of the system scheduler.  \\n  \\n A process consists of one or more threads and the code, data, and other resources of a program in memory. Typical program resources are open files, semaphores, and dynamically allocated memory. Each resource of a process is shared by all that process's threads.  \\n  \\n A program executes when the system scheduler gives execution control to one of the program's threads. The scheduler determines which threads should run and when. A lower-priority thread might be forced to wait while higher-priority threads complete their tasks. On multiprocessor computers, the scheduler can move individual threads to different processors, thus balancing the CPU load.  \\n  \\n Each process starts with a single thread, which is known as the primary thread. Any thread can create additional threads. All the threads within a process share the address space of that process.  \\n  \\n The primary thread is not necessarily located at the first index in the collection.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  Starting with the .NET Framework version 2.0, the ability to reference performance counter data on other computers has been eliminated for many of the .NET Framework methods and properties. This change was made to improve performance and to enable non-administrators to use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ProcessThread> class. As a result, some applications that did not get exceptions in earlier versions of the .NET Framework may now get a <xref:System.NotSupportedException>. The methods and properties affected are too numerous to list here, but the exception information has been added to the affected member topics.  \\n  \\n The threads of a process execute individually and are unaware of each other unless you make them visible to each other.
