For more information, see Permissions Requirements in [Binding Sources Overview](~/docs/framework/wpf/data/binding-sources-overview.md).  \\n  \\n There are many ways to create an object to use as a binding source. For example, you can create your object in the resources section of your [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](~/includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)] page, or you can create your object in code and set it as the `DataContext` of your window.  \\n  \\n <xref:System.Windows.Data.ObjectDataProvider> enables you to create your object in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] and make it available as a binding source. It provides the following properties that enable you to execute a query on your object and bind to the results.  \\n  \\n-   Use the <xref:System.Windows.Data.ObjectDataProvider.ConstructorParameters%2A> property to pass parameters to the constructor of your object.  \\n  \\n-   Use the <xref:System.Windows.Data.ObjectDataProvider.MethodName%2A> property to call a method and use the <xref:System.Windows.Data.ObjectDataProvider.MethodParameters%2A> property to pass parameters to the method. You can then bind to the results of the method.  \\n  \\n You can also use the <xref:System.Windows.Data.ObjectDataProvider.IsAsynchronous%2A> property to specify whether to perform object creation in a worker thread or in the active context.  \\n  \\n This class is also useful when you want to replace your current binding source object with another object and have all the associated bindings updated.  \\n  \\n <xref:System.Windows.Data.ObjectDataProvider> provides a convenient way to create and use objects as binding source objects in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)], but it does not replace existing data models.  \\n  \\n If you are implementing your own objects for data binding, see [Binding Sources Overview](~/docs/framework/wpf/data/binding-sources-overview.md) for information and recommendations.\"\n  syntax:\n    content: >-\n      [System.Windows.Localizability(System.Windows.LocalizationCategory.NeverLocalize)]\n\n      public class ObjectDataProvider : System.Windows.Data.DataSourceProvider\n  inheritance:\n  -
