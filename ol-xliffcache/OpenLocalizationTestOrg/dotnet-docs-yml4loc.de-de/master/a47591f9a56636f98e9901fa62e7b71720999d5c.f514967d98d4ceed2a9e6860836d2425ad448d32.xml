It provides a space-saving way to easily navigate a site and serves as a point of reference for where the currently displayed page is within a site. This type of control is commonly called a breadcrumb, or eyebrow, because it displays a hierarchical path of hyperlinked page names that provides an escape up the hierarchy of pages from the current location. <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapDataSource>. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath> is useful for sites that have deep hierarchical page structures, but where a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.TreeView> or <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Menu> might require too much space on a page.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath> control works directly with your Web site's site map data. If you use it on a page that is not represented in your site map, it will not be displayed. For more information about site maps, see [ASP.NET Site Navigation](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/23de8a05-cac3-4693-b508-39f1d4b7053d).  \n  \n<a name=\"nodes\"></a>   \n## Nodes  \n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath> is made up of nodes. Each element in the path is called a node and is represented by a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapNodeItem> object. The node that anchors the path and represents the base of the hierarchical tree is called the root node. The node that represents the currently displayed page is the current node. Any other node between the current node and root node is a parent node. The following table describes the three different node types.  \n  \n|Node type|Description|  \n|---------------|-----------------|  \n|root|A node that anchors a hierarchical set of nodes.|  \n|parent|A node that has one or more child nodes, but is not the current node.|  \n|current|A node that represents the currently displayed page.|  \n  \n<a name=\"node_appearance\"></a>   \n## Node Appearance  \n Each node displayed by a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath> is a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.HyperLink> or <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Literal> control that you can apply a template or style to. The templates and styles are applied to nodes according to two rules of precedence:  \n  \n-   If a template is defined for a node, it overrides any style defined for the node.  \n  \n-   Templates and styles that are specific to types of nodes override general templates and styles defined for all nodes.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.NodeStyle%2A> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.NodeTemplate%2A> properties are applied to all nodes, regardless of their node type. If both these properties are defined, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.NodeTemplate%2A> takes precedence.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.CurrentNodeTemplate%2A> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.CurrentNodeStyle%2A> properties are applied to nodes that represent the currently displayed page. If a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.NodeTemplate%2A> is defined in addition to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.CurrentNodeTemplate%2A>, it is ignored. If a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.NodeStyle%2A> is defined in addition to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.CurrentNodeStyle%2A>, it is merged with the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.CurrentNodeStyle%2A> to create a merged style. This merged style uses all the elements of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.CurrentNodeStyle%2A>, plus any additional elements of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.NodeStyle%2A> that do not conflict with the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.CurrentNodeStyle%2A>.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.RootNodeTemplate%2A> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.RootNodeStyle%2A> properties are applied to the node that represents the root of the site navigation hierarchy. If a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.NodeTemplate%2A> is defined in addition to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.RootNodeTemplate%2A>, it is ignored. If a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.NodeStyle%2A> is defined in addition to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.RootNodeStyle%2A>, it is merged with the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.RootNodeStyle%2A> to create a merged style. This merged style uses all the elements of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.RootNodeStyle%2A>, plus any additional elements of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.NodeStyle%2A> that did not conflict with the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.CurrentNodeStyle%2A>. Finally, if the currently displayed page is the root page of the site, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.RootNodeTemplate%2A> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.RootNodeStyle%2A> are used instead of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.CurrentNodeTemplate%2A> or <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.CurrentNodeStyle%2A>.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath> control uses the site map provider identified by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.SiteMapProvider%2A> property as its data source for site navigation information. If no provider is specified, it uses the default provider for the site, identified in the <xref:System.Web.SiteMap.Provider%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property. Typically, this is an instance of the default site map provider for ASP.NET, the <xref:System.Web.XmlSiteMapProvider>. If the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath> control is used within a site but no site map provider is configured, the control throws an <xref:System.Web.HttpException> exception.  \n  \n<a name=\"events\"></a>   \n## Events  \n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath> control also provides events that you can program against. This allows you to run a custom routine whenever an event occurs. The following table lists the events supported by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath> control.  \n  \n|Event|Description|  \n|-----------|-----------------|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.ItemCreated>|Occurs when the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath> control first creates a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapNodeItem> and associates it with a <xref:System.Web.SiteMapNode>.|  \n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.ItemDataBound>|Occurs when a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapNodeItem> is bound to site map data contained by the <xref:System.Web.SiteMapNode>.|  \n  \n<a name=\"customizing_the_sitemappath_control\"></a>   \n## Customizing the SiteMapPath Control  \n Classes that derive from <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath> override the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.InitializeItem%2A> method to customize the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapNodeItem> controls contained by the navigation control. For complete control over the way <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapNodeItem> objects are created and added to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath>, derived classes override the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.CreateControlHierarchy%2A> method.  \n  \n<a name=\"accessibility\"></a>   \n## Accessibility  \n For information about how to configure this control so that it generates markup that conforms to accessibility standards, see [Accessibility in Visual Studio and ASP.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/7e3ce9c4-6b7d-4fb1-94b5-72cf2a44fe13) and [ASP.NET Controls and Accessibility](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/847a37e3-ce20-41da-b0d3-7dfb0fdae9a0).  \n  \n<a name=\"declarative_syntax\"></a>   \n## Declarative Syntax  \n  \n```  \n<asp:SiteMapPath  \n    AccessKey=\"string\"  \n    BackColor=\"color name|#dddddd\"  \n    BorderColor=\"color name|#dddddd\"  \n    BorderStyle=\"NotSet|None|Dotted|Dashed|Solid|Double|Groove|Ridge|  \n        Inset|Outset\"  \n    BorderWidth=\"size\"  \n    CssClass=\"string\"  \n    Enabled=\"True|False\"  \n    EnableTheming=\"True|False\"  \n    EnableViewState=\"True|False\"  \n    Font-Bold=\"True|False\"  \n    Font-Italic=\"True|False\"  \n    Font-Names=\"string\"  \n    Font-Overline=\"True|False\"  \n    Font-Size=\"string|Smaller|Larger|XX-Small|X-Small|Small|Medium|  \n        Large|X-Large|XX-Large\"  \n    Font-Strikeout=\"True|False\"  \n    Font-Underline=\"True|False\"  \n    ForeColor=\"color name|#dddddd\"  \n    Height=\"size\"  \n    ID=\"string\"  \n    OnDataBinding=\"DataBinding event handler\"  \n    OnDisposed=\"Disposed event handler\"  \n    OnInit=\"Init event handler\"  \n    OnItemCreated=\"ItemCreated event handler\"  \n    OnItemDataBound=\"ItemDataBound event handler\"  \n    OnLoad=\"Load event handler\"  \n    OnPreRender=\"PreRender event handler\"  \n    OnUnload=\"Unload event handler\"  \n    ParentLevelsDisplayed=\"integer\"  \n    PathDirection=\"RootToCurrent|CurrentToRoot\"  \n    PathSeparator=\"string\"  \n    RenderCurrentNodeAsLink=\"True|False\"  \n    runat=\"server\"  \n    ShowToolTips=\"True|False\"  \n    SiteMapProvider=\"string\"  \n    SkinID=\"string\"  \n    SkipLinkText=\"string\"  \n    Style=\"string\"  \n    TabIndex=\"integer\"  \n    ToolTip=\"string\"  \n    Visible=\"True|False\"  \n    Width=\"size\"  \n>  \n        <CurrentNodeStyle />  \n        <CurrentNodeTemplate>  \n            <!-- child controls -->  \n        </CurrentNodeTemplate>  \n        <NodeStyle />  \n        <NodeTemplate>  \n            <!-- child controls -->  \n        </NodeTemplate>  \n        <PathSeparatorStyle />  \n        <PathSeparatorTemplate>  \n            <!-- child controls -->  \n        </PathSeparatorTemplate>  \n        <RootNodeStyle />  \n        <RootNodeTemplate>  \n            <!-- child controls -->  \n        </RootNodeTemplate>  \n</asp:SiteMapPath>  \n```","nodes":[{"pos":[0,14],"content":"In this topic:","nodes":[{"content":"In this topic:","pos":[0,14]}]},{"pos":[24,53],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Introduction<ept id=\"p1\">](#introduction)</ept>","source":"[Introduction](#introduction)"},{"pos":[63,78],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Nodes<ept id=\"p1\">](#nodes)</ept>","source":"[Nodes](#nodes)"},{"pos":[88,123],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Node Appearance<ept id=\"p1\">](#node_appearance)</ept>","source":"[Node Appearance](#node_appearance)"},{"pos":[133,150],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Events<ept id=\"p1\">](#events)</ept>","source":"[Events](#events)"},{"pos":[160,235],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Customizing the SiteMapPath Control<ept id=\"p1\">](#customizing_the_sitemappath_control)</ept>","source":"[Customizing the SiteMapPath Control](#customizing_the_sitemappath_control)"},{"pos":[245,276],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Accessibility<ept id=\"p1\">](#accessibility)</ept>","source":"[Accessibility](#accessibility)"},{"pos":[286,327],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Declarative Syntax<ept id=\"p1\">](#declarative_syntax)</ept>","source":"[Declarative Syntax](#declarative_syntax)"},{"pos":[367,379],"content":"Introduction","linkify":"Introduction","nodes":[{"content":"Introduction","pos":[0,12]}]},{"pos":[383,1196],"content":"The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath> control is a site navigation control that reflects data provided by the <xref:System.Web.SiteMap> object.

It provides a space-saving way to easily navigate a site and serves as a point of reference for where the currently displayed page is within a site. This type of control is commonly called a breadcrumb, or eyebrow, because it displays a hierarchical path of hyperlinked page names that provides an escape up the hierarchy of pages from the current location. <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapDataSource>. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath> is useful for sites that have deep hierarchical page structures, but where a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.TreeView> or <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Menu> might require too much space on a page.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath> control works directly with your Web site's site map data. If you use it on a page that is not represented in your site map, it will not be displayed. For more information about site maps, see [ASP.NET Site Navigation](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/23de8a05-cac3-4693-b508-39f1d4b7053d).  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"nodes\\\"></a>   \\n## Nodes  \\n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath> is made up of nodes. Each element in the path is called a node and is represented by a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapNodeItem> object. The node that anchors the path and represents the base of the hierarchical tree is called the root node. The node that represents the currently displayed page is the current node. Any other node between the current node and root node is a parent node. The following table describes the three different node types.  \\n  \\n|Node type|Description|  \\n|---------------|-----------------|  \\n|root|A node that anchors a hierarchical set of nodes.|  \\n|parent|A node that has one or more child nodes, but is not the current node.|  \\n|current|A node that represents the currently displayed page.|  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"node_appearance\\\"></a>   \\n## Node Appearance  \\n Each node displayed by a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath> is a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.HyperLink> or <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Literal> control that you can apply a template or style to. The templates and styles are applied to nodes according to two rules of precedence:  \\n  \\n-   If a template is defined for a node, it overrides any style defined for the node.  \\n  \\n-   Templates and styles that are specific to types of nodes override general templates and styles defined for all nodes.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.NodeStyle%2A> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.NodeTemplate%2A> properties are applied to all nodes, regardless of their node type. If both these properties are defined, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.NodeTemplate%2A> takes precedence.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.CurrentNodeTemplate%2A> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.CurrentNodeStyle%2A> properties are applied to nodes that represent the currently displayed page. If a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.NodeTemplate%2A> is defined in addition to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.CurrentNodeTemplate%2A>, it is ignored. If a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.NodeStyle%2A> is defined in addition to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.CurrentNodeStyle%2A>, it is merged with the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.CurrentNodeStyle%2A> to create a merged style. This merged style uses all the elements of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.CurrentNodeStyle%2A>, plus any additional elements of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.NodeStyle%2A> that do not conflict with the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.CurrentNodeStyle%2A>.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.RootNodeTemplate%2A> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.RootNodeStyle%2A> properties are applied to the node that represents the root of the site navigation hierarchy. If a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.NodeTemplate%2A> is defined in addition to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.RootNodeTemplate%2A>, it is ignored. If a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.NodeStyle%2A> is defined in addition to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.RootNodeStyle%2A>, it is merged with the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.RootNodeStyle%2A> to create a merged style. This merged style uses all the elements of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.RootNodeStyle%2A>, plus any additional elements of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.NodeStyle%2A> that did not conflict with the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.CurrentNodeStyle%2A>. Finally, if the currently displayed page is the root page of the site, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.RootNodeTemplate%2A> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.RootNodeStyle%2A> are used instead of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.CurrentNodeTemplate%2A> or <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.CurrentNodeStyle%2A>.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath> control uses the site map provider identified by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.SiteMapProvider%2A> property as its data source for site navigation information. If no provider is specified, it uses the default provider for the site, identified in the <xref:System.Web.SiteMap.Provider%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property. Typically, this is an instance of the default site map provider for ASP.NET, the <xref:System.Web.XmlSiteMapProvider>. If the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath> control is used within a site but no site map provider is configured, the control throws an <xref:System.Web.HttpException> exception.  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"events\\\"></a>   \\n## Events  \\n The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath> control also provides events that you can program against. This allows you to run a custom routine whenever an event occurs. The following table lists the events supported by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath> control.  \\n  \\n|Event|Description|  \\n|-----------|-----------------|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.ItemCreated>|Occurs when the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath> control first creates a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapNodeItem> and associates it with a <xref:System.Web.SiteMapNode>.|  \\n|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.ItemDataBound>|Occurs when a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapNodeItem> is bound to site map data contained by the <xref:System.Web.SiteMapNode>.|  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"customizing_the_sitemappath_control\\\"></a>   \\n## Customizing the SiteMapPath Control  \\n Classes that derive from <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath> override the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.InitializeItem%2A> method to customize the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapNodeItem> controls contained by the navigation control. For complete control over the way <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapNodeItem> objects are created and added to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath>, derived classes override the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.CreateControlHierarchy%2A> method.  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"accessibility\\\"></a>   \\n## Accessibility  \\n For information about how to configure this control so that it generates markup that conforms to accessibility standards, see [Accessibility in Visual Studio and ASP.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/7e3ce9c4-6b7d-4fb1-94b5-72cf2a44fe13) and [ASP.NET Controls and Accessibility](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/847a37e3-ce20-41da-b0d3-7dfb0fdae9a0).  \\n  \\n<a name=\\\"declarative_syntax\\\"></a>   \\n## Declarative Syntax  \\n  \\n```  \\n<asp:SiteMapPath  \\n    AccessKey=\\\"string\\\"  \\n    BackColor=\\\"color name|#dddddd\\\"  \\n    BorderColor=\\\"color name|#dddddd\\\"  \\n    BorderStyle=\\\"NotSet|None|Dotted|Dashed|Solid|Double|Groove|Ridge|  \\n        Inset|Outset\\\"  \\n    BorderWidth=\\\"size\\\"  \\n    CssClass=\\\"string\\\"  \\n    Enabled=\\\"True|False\\\"  \\n    EnableTheming=\\\"True|False\\\"  \\n    EnableViewState=\\\"True|False\\\"  \\n    Font-Bold=\\\"True|False\\\"  \\n    Font-Italic=\\\"True|False\\\"  \\n    Font-Names=\\\"string\\\"  \\n    Font-Overline=\\\"True|False\\\"  \\n    Font-Size=\\\"string|Smaller|Larger|XX-Small|X-Small|Small|Medium|  \\n        Large|X-Large|XX-Large\\\"  \\n    Font-Strikeout=\\\"True|False\\\"  \\n    Font-Underline=\\\"True|False\\\"  \\n    ForeColor=\\\"color name|#dddddd\\\"  \\n    Height=\\\"size\\\"  \\n    ID=\\\"string\\\"  \\n    OnDataBinding=\\\"DataBinding event handler\\\"  \\n    OnDisposed=\\\"Disposed event handler\\\"  \\n    OnInit=\\\"Init event handler\\\"  \\n    OnItemCreated=\\\"ItemCreated event handler\\\"  \\n    OnItemDataBound=\\\"ItemDataBound event handler\\\"  \\n    OnLoad=\\\"Load event handler\\\"  \\n    OnPreRender=\\\"PreRender event handler\\\"  \\n    OnUnload=\\\"Unload event handler\\\"  \\n    ParentLevelsDisplayed=\\\"integer\\\"  \\n    PathDirection=\\\"RootToCurrent|CurrentToRoot\\\"  \\n    PathSeparator=\\\"string\\\"  \\n    RenderCurrentNodeAsLink=\\\"True|False\\\"  \\n    runat=\\\"server\\\"  \\n    ShowToolTips=\\\"True|False\\\"  \\n    SiteMapProvider=\\\"string\\\"  \\n    SkinID=\\\"string\\\"  \\n    SkipLinkText=\\\"string\\\"  \\n    Style=\\\"string\\\"  \\n    TabIndex=\\\"integer\\\"  \\n    ToolTip=\\\"string\\\"  \\n    Visible=\\\"True|False\\\"  \\n    Width=\\\"size\\\"  \\n>  \\n        <CurrentNodeStyle />  \\n        <CurrentNodeTemplate>  \\n            <!-- child controls -->  \\n        </CurrentNodeTemplate>  \\n        <NodeStyle />  \\n        <NodeTemplate>  \\n            <!-- child controls -->  \\n        </NodeTemplate>  \\n        <PathSeparatorStyle />  \\n        <PathSeparatorTemplate>  \\n            <!-- child controls -->  \\n        </PathSeparatorTemplate>  \\n        <RootNodeStyle />  \\n        <RootNodeTemplate>  \\n            <!-- child controls -->  \\n        </RootNodeTemplate>  \\n</asp:SiteMapPath>  \\n```\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example uses a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath> control declaratively in a Web Forms page.

This example demonstrates how to work with <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapNodeItem> objects, including checking their <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapNodeItemType> and calling the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.SiteMapPath.OnItemCreated%2A> method after the items are created.  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[Urtue.Samples.Alexkr.DropDownNavigationPath_1#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_WebNet/Urtue.Samples.Alexkr.DropDownNavigationPath_1/CS/dropdownnavigationpath.cs#1)]\\n [!code-vb[Urtue.Samples.Alexkr.DropDownNavigationPath_1#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_WebNet/Urtue.Samples.Alexkr.DropDownNavigationPath_1/VB/dropdownnavigationpath.vb#1)]\"\n  syntax:\n    content: 'public class SiteMapPath : System.Web.UI.WebControls.CompositeControl'\n  inheritance:\n  -
