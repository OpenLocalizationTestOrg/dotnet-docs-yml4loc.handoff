For example, if the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.InstanceContextMode%2A> value is set to <xref:System.ServiceModel.InstanceContextMode.Single> the result is that your service can only process one message at a time unless you also set the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.ConcurrencyMode%2A> value to <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode.Multiple>. This property also produces behavior in combination with the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceContractAttribute.SessionMode%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property. For details, see [Sessions, Instancing, and Concurrency](~/docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/sessions-instancing-and-concurrency.md).  \n  \n Setting <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode> to <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode.Single> instructs the system to restrict instances of the service to one thread of execution at a time, which frees you from dealing with threading issues. A value of <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode.Multiple> means that service objects can be executed by multiple threads at any one time. In this case, you must ensure thread safety.  \n  \n <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode.Reentrant> also restricts access to a single thread at a time; while the operation is processing, no other message can enter the operation. If during the operation a call to another service leaves, the current message loses the lock on the operation, which is free to process other messages. When the service call out returns, the lock is reestablished and the original message can continue processing to its conclusion or until another call out of the operation occurs.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  Even though <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode.Single> restricts instances of the service to one thread of execution at a time, you must also set <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceThrottlingBehavior.MaxConcurrentCalls%2A> to 1 to guarantee no out-of-order messages.  \n>   \n>  Also, it is your responsibility to leave your object state consistent before callouts and you must confirm that operation-local data is valid after callouts. Note that the service instance is unlocked only by calling another service over a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](~/includes/indigo2-md.md)] channel. In this case, the called service can reenter the first service via a callback. If the first service is not reentrant, the sequence of calls results in a deadlock. For details, see <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode>.  \n  \n During any outbound call from a processing operation, data not local to the operation can be modified. (Local state data is guaranteed to be valid when the original message resumes processing.) As a result, before your outbound call you must ensure that non-local data is valid for other incoming calls and revalidate non-local data after the outbound call returns.  \n  \n The following pseudo-code illustrates the required pattern for successful reentrant support.  \n  \n```csharp  \npublic void MyMethod()  \n{  \n  this.SomeNonLocalDataState;  \n  // Here you need to clean nonlocal state for other users  \n  OutboundProxy proxy = new OutboundProxy();  \n  int returnValue = proxy.CallOutOfOperation();  \n  // Ensure that this.SomeNonLocalDataState is valid for continued use.  \n  this.ModifyNonLocalState;  \n  return returnValue;  \n}  \n  \n```  \n  \n Using the Begin/End asynchronous call pattern for an outbound call when the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.ConcurrencyMode%2A> is <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode.Reentrant> triggers an exception. Asynchronous outbound calls require an operation in which <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.ConcurrencyMode%2A> is <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode.Multiple>, in which case you must handle synchronization issues.  \n  \n Generally, if a message arrives for an instance that violates its concurrency mode, the message waits until the instance is available, or until it times out.  \n  \n In addition, if the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode> is set to <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode.Single> and a reentrant call is blocked while waiting for the instance to be freed, the system detects the deadlock and throws an exception.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  A <xref:System.InvalidOperationException> is thrown at runtime if <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.ReleaseServiceInstanceOnTransactionComplete%2A> is `true` when the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.ConcurrencyMode%2A> property is set to <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode.Single>.  \n  \n Note that you must explicitly set <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.ReleaseServiceInstanceOnTransactionComplete%2A> to `false` if there is an operation with <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationBehaviorAttribute.TransactionScopeRequired%2A?displayProperty=fullName> set to true and you set <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.ConcurrencyMode%2A> to <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode.Reentrant>. Otherwise a validation exception is thrown because the default value of <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.ReleaseServiceInstanceOnTransactionComplete%2A> is `true`.  \n  \n There is an interaction of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.ConcurrencyMode%2A> and other properties that can alter runtime behavior.

(To specify execution behavior at the method level, use the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationBehaviorAttribute> attribute.) This attribute can be applied only to service implementations. For working examples, see the [Service Behaviors Samples](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/4e3c6513-a7ff-4b35-8dcf-b5506c6f39a7).  \\n  \\n <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute> properties are a [!INCLUDE[indigo1](~/includes/indigo1-md.md)] programming model feature that enables common features that developers otherwise have to implement. For more information about these and other behaviors, see [Specifying Service Run-Time Behavior](~/docs/framework/wcf/specifying-service-run-time-behavior.md). For more information about the underlying runtime properties that some of the following properties set, see [Extending ServiceHost and the Service Model Layer](~/docs/framework/wcf/extending/extending-servicehost-and-the-service-model-layer.md).  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.AddressFilterMode%2A> property specifies the type of filter that the dispatcher system uses to locate the endpoint that handles requests.  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.AutomaticSessionShutdown%2A> property automatically closes the session when the channel is closed and the service has finished processing any remaining messages.  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.ConcurrencyMode%2A> property controls the internal threading model, enabling support for reentrant or multithreaded services.  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.ConfigurationName%2A> property is used to declare a name for use in the `name` attribute of the `<service>` element in a configuration file.  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.IgnoreExtensionDataObject%2A> property enables the run time to ignore extra serialization information that is not required to process the message.  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.IncludeExceptionDetailInFaults%2A> property specifies whether unhandled exceptions in a service are returned as SOAP faults. This is for debugging purposes only.  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.InstanceContextMode%2A> property specifies whether and when services and their service objects are to be recycled during an exchange with a client.  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.MaxItemsInObjectGraph%2A> property to limit on the number of items in an object graph that are serialized.  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.Name%2A> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.Namespace%2A> properties control the name and namespace for the WSDL expression of the service element.  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.ReleaseServiceInstanceOnTransactionComplete%2A> property specifies whether the service object is recycled when a transaction completes.  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.TransactionAutoCompleteOnSessionClose%2A> property specifies whether outstanding transactions are completed when the session closes.  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.TransactionIsolationLevel%2A> property specifies the transaction isolation level that the contract supports.  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.TransactionTimeout%2A> property specifies the time period within which a transaction must complete or it aborts.  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.UseSynchronizationContext%2A> property indicates whether to synchronize inbound method calls with the user interface thread automatically.  \\n  \\n-   The <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.ValidateMustUnderstand%2A> property informs the system whether it should confirm that SOAP headers marked as `MustUnderstand` have, in fact, been understood.  \\n  \\n The <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.IncludeExceptionDetailInFaults%2A> property can also be set using an application configuration file. For details, see <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceDebugBehavior.IncludeExceptionDetailInFaults%2A>.\"\n  example:\n  - \"The following code example demonstrates the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute> properties. The `BehaviorService` class uses the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute> attribute to indicate that:  \\n  \\n-   The service object is recycled when the transaction completes.  \\n  \\n-   There is one service object for each session.  \\n  \\n-   The service is single-threaded and does not support reentrant calls.  \\n  \\n Furthermore, at the operation level, the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationBehaviorAttribute> values indicate that the `TxWork` method automatically enlists in flowed transactions or creates a new transaction to do the work, and that the transaction is committed automatically if an unhandled exception does not occur.  \\n  \\n [!code-csharp[OperationBehaviorAttribute1#2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/operationbehaviorattribute1/cs/services.cs#2)]\\n [!code-vb[OperationBehaviorAttribute1#2](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/operationbehaviorattribute1/vb/services.vb#2)]  \\n  \\n The underlying binding must support flowed transactions for the following code example to execute properly.

For example, if the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.InstanceContextMode%2A> value is set to <xref:System.ServiceModel.InstanceContextMode.Single> the result is that your service can only process one message at a time unless you also set the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.ConcurrencyMode%2A> value to <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode.Multiple>. This property also produces behavior in combination with the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceContractAttribute.SessionMode%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property. For details, see [Sessions, Instancing, and Concurrency](~/docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/sessions-instancing-and-concurrency.md).  \\n  \\n Setting <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode> to <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode.Single> instructs the system to restrict instances of the service to one thread of execution at a time, which frees you from dealing with threading issues. A value of <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode.Multiple> means that service objects can be executed by multiple threads at any one time. In this case, you must ensure thread safety.  \\n  \\n <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode.Reentrant> also restricts access to a single thread at a time; while the operation is processing, no other message can enter the operation. If during the operation a call to another service leaves, the current message loses the lock on the operation, which is free to process other messages. When the service call out returns, the lock is reestablished and the original message can continue processing to its conclusion or until another call out of the operation occurs.  \\n  \\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\n>  Even though <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode.Single> restricts instances of the service to one thread of execution at a time, you must also set <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceThrottlingBehavior.MaxConcurrentCalls%2A> to 1 to guarantee no out-of-order messages.  \\n>   \\n>  Also, it is your responsibility to leave your object state consistent before callouts and you must confirm that operation-local data is valid after callouts. Note that the service instance is unlocked only by calling another service over a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](~/includes/indigo2-md.md)] channel. In this case, the called service can reenter the first service via a callback. If the first service is not reentrant, the sequence of calls results in a deadlock. For details, see <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode>.  \\n  \\n During any outbound call from a processing operation, data not local to the operation can be modified. (Local state data is guaranteed to be valid when the original message resumes processing.) As a result, before your outbound call you must ensure that non-local data is valid for other incoming calls and revalidate non-local data after the outbound call returns.  \\n  \\n The following pseudo-code illustrates the required pattern for successful reentrant support.  \\n  \\n```csharp  \\npublic void MyMethod()  \\n{  \\n  this.SomeNonLocalDataState;  \\n  // Here you need to clean nonlocal state for other users  \\n  OutboundProxy proxy = new OutboundProxy();  \\n  int returnValue = proxy.CallOutOfOperation();  \\n  // Ensure that this.SomeNonLocalDataState is valid for continued use.  \\n  this.ModifyNonLocalState;  \\n  return returnValue;  \\n}  \\n  \\n```  \\n  \\n Using the Begin/End asynchronous call pattern for an outbound call when the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.ConcurrencyMode%2A> is <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode.Reentrant> triggers an exception. Asynchronous outbound calls require an operation in which <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.ConcurrencyMode%2A> is <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode.Multiple>, in which case you must handle synchronization issues.  \\n  \\n Generally, if a message arrives for an instance that violates its concurrency mode, the message waits until the instance is available, or until it times out.  \\n  \\n In addition, if the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode> is set to <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode.Single> and a reentrant call is blocked while waiting for the instance to be freed, the system detects the deadlock and throws an exception.  \\n  \\n> [!NOTE]\\n>  A <xref:System.InvalidOperationException> is thrown at runtime if <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.ReleaseServiceInstanceOnTransactionComplete%2A> is `true` when the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.ConcurrencyMode%2A> property is set to <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode.Single>.  \\n  \\n Note that you must explicitly set <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.ReleaseServiceInstanceOnTransactionComplete%2A> to `false` if there is an operation with <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationBehaviorAttribute.TransactionScopeRequired%2A?displayProperty=fullName> set to true and you set <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.ConcurrencyMode%2A> to <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode.Reentrant>. Otherwise a validation exception is thrown because the default value of <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.ReleaseServiceInstanceOnTransactionComplete%2A> is `true`.  \\n  \\n There is an interaction of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.ConcurrencyMode%2A> and other properties that can alter runtime behavior.
